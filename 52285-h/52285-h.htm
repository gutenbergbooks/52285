<h2><a name="EDITORIAL_PREFACE" id="EDITORIAL_PREFACE">EDITORIAL PREFACE.</a></h2>

<p>The story of the world’s exploration is always attractive.
We naturally take a keen interest in the personality
of the men who have dared to force their way
into the unknown, and so unveiled to us the face of
mother earth. The interest in the work of exploration
has been particularly strong and widespread in recent
years, and it is believed that a series of volumes dealing
with the great explorers and explorations of the past
is likely to prove welcome to a wide circle of readers.
Without a knowledge of what has been accomplished,
the results of the unprecedented exploring activity of
the present cannot be understood. It is hoped, therefore,
that the present series will supply a real want.
With one or two exceptions, each volume will deal
mainly with one leading explorer, bringing out prominently
the man’s personality, telling the story of his
life, and showing in full detail what he did for the exploration
of the world. When it may be necessary to
depart somewhat from the general plan, it will always
be kept in view that the series is essentially a popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
one. When complete the series will form a Biographical
History of Geographical Discovery.</p>

<p>The Editors congratulate themselves on having been
able to secure the co-operation of men well known as
the highest authorities in their own departments; their
names are too familiar to the public to require introduction.
Each writer is of course entirely responsible
for his own work.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>THE FIRST GLIMMERING OF LIGHT.</i></span></h2>

<p>To find the first allusion to the River Niger we have
to go back to the very dawn of history.</p>

<p>Many centuries before the Christian era the spirit of
geographical inquiry was abroad. There were then, as
in later times, ardent minds whose eager curiosity would
not let them rest content with a knowledge of their own
countries. Then, as in the Middle Ages, kings and emperors
thirsted for political aggrandisement, merchants
for new sources of wealth, and enterprising spirits for
opportunities to do deeds of high emprise which would
send their names down to posterity.</p>

<p>Phœnicia, Greece, Carthage, Rome, had each its bold
navigators and travellers, whose explorations can be
more or less credibly gleaned from the mass of fable
and misrepresentation which time and ignorance have
gathered round them.</p>

<p>Even in those early days&mdash;twenty or more centuries
ago&mdash;Africa was the chief centre of attraction to such as
longed to extend their possessions or their knowledge of
the earth’s surface. Already the mystery of the Nile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
and Inner Africa beyond the Great Desert had asserted
its fascination over men’s minds. The Mediterranean
nations vied with each other in sending expedition after
expedition to explore the coast-line, and if possible
circumnavigate the continent. Of these some ventured
by way of the Straits of Gibraltar&mdash;the Pillars of
Hercules, as they were then called&mdash;while others tried
the Red Sea and the eastern coast. What these ancient
mariners actually accomplished has been for centuries a
matter of keen dispute, with but small clearing up of
the obscure horizon. It is not therefore for us to enter
into the debatable land, and happily the questions involved
lie outside our province. Sufficient for our purpose
is it to know that very extensive voyages were
undertaken along both the east and west coasts of
Africa. Among the most noteworthy and credible of
these is the expedition sent by Necho, King of Egypt,
with Phœnician navigators, which is said to have accomplished
the circumnavigation of the continent; and the
Carthaginian expedition of Hanno, which undoubtedly
explored the western coast for a very considerable distance
towards the equator.</p>

<p>But the enterprise of the Mediterranean nations was
not confined only to the coast-line. The commercial
spirit of Carthage and the warlike genius of Rome alike
led them to seek the interior.</p>

<p>In this direction, however, each was fated to be as
effectually checked as their sailors had been by sea. The
burning heat, the wide stretches of barren sand, the waterless
wastes, and the savage nomads which they had to
encounter, were as terrible to face as the huge waves and
frightful storms of the Atlantic. To the natural terrors
of this desert region, forsaken of the gods, their imagi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>nation
added every conceivable monstrosity, so that he
indeed was a bold man who ventured from the gay and
pleasant confines of the northern lands into the awful
horrors of the Sahara.</p>

<p>Yet men there must have been, whether warriors,
merchants, or simple explorers, we know not, who
crossed the dreaded desert zone, and reached the more
fertile countries of the negroes which lay beyond. In
the pages of Herodotus and Strabo, of Pliny and of
Ptolemy, amid all the mythological absurdities and
ridiculous stories with which they abound, we find not
only ample evidence of such successful adventure, but
a wonderfully just estimate of the physical conditions
which characterised the region lying between the Mediterranean
and the Sudan. They describe first a zone of
sharply contrasted fertility and barrenness, of green oasis
and repellent desert, scantily inhabited by wild, roving
tribes. Next comes a more terrible region lying further
to the south&mdash;a land of desolation and death, swept by
the wild sirocco and sandstorm, burnt by fierce relentless
suns, unrefreshed by sparkling earth-born springs,
unmoistened by the heaven-sent rain or by the gentle
dew of night. Beyond lies a third region&mdash;the land of
the negroes&mdash;made fertile by spring and stream, by
marsh and lake.</p>

<p>More remarkable still is the fact that in each of the
writers mentioned we find clear indications of a knowledge
of a great river running through Negroland.</p>

<p>With minds on the search for a solution of the Nile
problems&mdash;its origin, its course, and the mystery of its
annual overflow&mdash;and from the likelihood that some of
their informants had actually seen this river when it
ran in an easterly direction, the opinion generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
adopted by the ancients was that the river of the
negroes was the Nile itself.</p>

<p>Of the various sources of information upon which the
classical writers depended for their descriptions of these
savage lands we know but little. One there is, however,
which stands out with wonderful clearness and prominence
and a general air of credibility&mdash;the expedition
of the Nasamones as related by Herodotus.</p>

<p>The Nasamones&mdash;five young men of distinction, doubtless
without suitable outlets for their ambitions and
energies at home&mdash;set out from their native country
to the south-west of Egypt, bent on the exploration
of the heart of Africa.</p>

<p>Travelling partly south and partly west, they crossed
the semi-inhabited, semi-sterile zone. Arrived at the
confines of the great desert, they collected provisions
and supplied themselves with water, and bold in heart
“to seek, to conquer, or to die,” plunged into the terrible
unknown. For many weary days they pursued
their quest with unabated courage and perseverance.
At length they emerged from the region of desolation
and death, and found themselves in a fertile country
inhabited by pigmies, having abundance of fruit trees,
and watered by vast lakes and marshes. Furthermore,
they found a large river flowing from west to
east.</p>

<p>Whether these enterprising young African explorers
had reached the neighbourhood of Lake Chad, as we
might be disposed to believe, or the Niger in the vicinity
of the great bend of the main stream, it would be waste
of time to ask. Let us be satisfied with knowing that
at this very early period of the world’s history, many
centuries before the Christian era, the Central or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Western Sudan of our days was reached, and the fact
established that through it ran a great river.</p>

<p>In this way the exploration of Central Africa was
inaugurated&mdash;the first uncertain glimmer of light thrown
upon its dark surface; and the River Niger revealed to
the world to be a theme of discussion to arm-chair
geographers, and a goal to be aimed at by the more
adventurous spirits who would realise their thoughts
in deeds rather than on paper.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>MORE LIGHT: THE ARAB PERIOD.</i></span></h2>

<p>For many centuries but little was added to the knowledge
of Africa acquired by the early classical writers.
Carthage fell from its high estate, and on its ruins
Rome, with boundless ambition and seemingly boundless
powers of attainment, built for itself a new and
equally magnificent African Empire. But where man
could not stay the advancing tide, Nature set bounds
to the force of Roman arms, and at the borders of
the desert mutely said, “Thus far shalt thou go, and
no further.”</p>

<p>The Roman power rose to the zenith of its glory,
and still the desert remained uncrossed; it dwindled
towards its fall, and then its days of geographical conquest
were over. In Northern Africa, as elsewhere,
the mythological gave place to the Christian era, and
the influence of the new religion spread apparently to
the remotest desert tribes. It was not, however, fated
to be permanent. In the seventh century a new prophet
had risen in the Sacred East, and the seeds of a mighty
revolution were germinating in the deserts of Arabia.
The boundaries of its parent country soon proved too
small for the astonishing vitalities and ardent missionary
enterprise of the new faith&mdash;the faith of Islam. Bursting
out, it pushed with incredible rapidity along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
north of Africa, overwhelming Paganism and Christianity
alike in its irresistible course, till reaching the
Atlantic it turned to north and south in search of new
fields to conquer for God. The natural difficulties which
had stopped the southern progress of the Carthaginians
and the Romans formed no barrier to a people born in
a desert. In the plateau lands of the Berber tribes the
Arabs were at home. Winged with a fiery enthusiasm
which nothing could withstand, and inspired by a hope
of heaven which nothing could shake, they swept from
district to district, from tribe to tribe, everywhere carrying
the blazing torch of Islam, everywhere striking
fire from the roving people with whom they came in
contact, till from every Saharan oasis there was heard
the common cry, “There is no God but the one God.”
In the new conflagration Christian symbols and Pagan
idols alike disappeared in one fell holocaust.</p>

<p>To a race so educated and nurtured, so steeped in
fiery ardour and unquenchable faith, and so imbued
with the paramount importance of their mission&mdash;provided,
moreover, as regards the practical part of their
work, with the drought-enduring camel, hitherto unknown
in Africa&mdash;the so-called impassable desert was
no barrier to the performance of the task divinely set
them. Only for him who turned back did hell yawn.
For him who went forward it might be death, but it
was death with Paradise gained.</p>

<p>In this spirit the terrors of the Sahara were faced,
and faced only to be conquered; and ere the ninth
century gave place to the tenth, the land of the negroes
was reached, and the forces of Islam set themselves in
array against those of heathendom. For the first time
the Niger basin was now brought into direct relation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
with Northern Africa. The actual time when this was
accomplished is still a matter of some doubt, though the
statement is quoted by Barth that within less than a
hundred years of the commencement of the Mohammedan
era, schools and mosques were established in the
negro kingdom of Ghana or Ghanata, to the west of
Timbuktu. More incontestable is the statement of the
Arab writer, Ebn Khaldun (<span class="small">A.D.</span> 1380), that trading
relations existed about 280 <span class="small">A.H.</span> or 893 <span class="small">A.D.</span> between
the Upper Niger and Northern Africa. When these
were first established we are not informed.</p>

<p>The vital forces which had found no barrier in the
fierce nomads and physical difficulties of the Sahara,
and had carried the disciples of Mohammed to the
borders of the Sudan, met a check to their sweeping
progress where one would have least expected it. Half
the secret of the success of Islam had been that
principle in the creed which was calculated to attract
and inflame the ardent imaginations and easily excited
temperaments of the Berber tribes of the north. With
these Mohammedanism required but little aid from fire
and sword for the spread of its tenets. It had but to
be preached to be believed, making every hearer not
only a convert but a missionary aflame with enthusiasm
for the cause of God and Mohammed. Such, however,
was not the case when Islam came face to face with the
undeveloped lethargic minds of the barbarous blacks of
the Sudan. The intellect of the negro had to be prepared
for the reception of the new spiritual doctrines.</p>

<p>For a time a hard and fast line existed between Islam
and Heathendom more or less closely coinciding with
that drawn between Berber and Negro, Sahara and
Sudan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>Only for a time, however. Though the new religious
force could sweep on no longer in an irresistible, all-embracing
tide, it was not to be prevented from gradually
working its way into the sodden mass of Paganism.
Along the whole line of opposing forces from Senegambia
to Lake Chad, Mohammedan missionaries penetrated,
not with fire and sword and all the horrors of
brute force, but armed with the spiritual weapons of faith,
hope, and ardent enthusiasm. Under their fostering
care schools and mosques arose, around which converts
gathered in ever-increasing numbers, until at length
every region had its leavening germs, and awaited but
the proper moment and the inspired leader to raise the
watchword of Islam, and once more sweep onward with
all the accumulated force of the dammed back torrent.</p>

<p>Within a short time of each other two such leaders
appeared at opposite points of the Niger basin. In
the west, near the great bend of the Niger, a king of
Songhay embraced Islam about the year 1000, while
near the close of the same century a king of Bornu
followed his example.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>From those dates a new and more promising era commenced
for the Central and Western Sudan. Under the
fostering care and impulse of the new religion these
backward regions commenced an upward progress. A
new and powerful bond drew the scattered congeries
of tribes together and welded them into powerful communities.
Their moral and spiritual well-being increased
by leaps and bounds, and their political and social life
took an altogether higher level. The arts and industries
of the North speedily became established among them,
and with them came the love of decent dress, of cleanli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>ness,
of more orderly conduct. Whatever might be said
of Mohammedanism in its final influence, there could be
no question but that it had the amount of good in it
necessary to raise a barbarous people to a higher level of
civilisation. There was an adaptability and a simplicity
about it well suited to the comprehension of untutored
minds, and in that lay the secret of a success such as
has never since been even distantly approached by any
other propagandist religion in Africa.</p>

<p>To the rulers of Songhay and Bornu the watchword of
Islam, “There is no God but the one God,” soon became
a war-cry destined to be irresistible in its magic influence.
Armed with the new spiritual force these hitherto
barbarous kingdoms rose to extraordinary heights of
power. Songhay gradually spread its influence over all
the upper reaches of the Niger till it had absorbed the
old kingdoms of Ghanata, to the north of the Niger, and
Melli, to the south. With the political influences of
Songhay went the religious forces at its back. At times
there were checks to its military power, but only when
the religious enthusiasm and missionary ardour of its
rulers temporarily sank and were outstripped by the
greater zeal of neighbouring princes. With these exceptions,
the history of Songhay was that of general progress,
political, social, and commercial. The kingdom reached
the zenith of its power at the beginning of the sixteenth
century under a powerful negro king named Hadj
Mohammed Askia, whose rule extended from the centre
of the present empire of Sokoto to the borders of the
Atlantic, a distance from east to west of 1500 miles,
and from Mosi in the south as far as the oasis of Tawat
in the north, <i>i.e.</i>, something over 1000 miles.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>Askia was no mere warrior anxious for his own
aggrandisement. As was the case with all the great
Sudanese rulers of those early days, he was noted for
his ardent faith as well as for his love of justice and
clemency, so that, as his historian, Ahmed Baba of Timbuktu,
wrote of him, “God made use of his services in
order to save the true believers (in Negroland) from
their sufferings and calamities.” He built mosques and
schools, and did everything in his power to encourage
learning; and not unmindful of the material prosperity
of his people, encouraged merchants from all parts of
the Sudan, the Sahara, and North Africa. Thus not
only was he loved and revered by his subjects, but his
fame extended to the most distant countries.</p>

<p>Unhappily the magnificent empire thus founded had
not the elements of stability. There was too much of
the one man power, with no firm governmental foundations
apart from the ruler. In consequence, the history
of Songhay was one of varying fortunes. Old kingdoms
such as Melli temporarily regained their independence,
distant provinces were continually breaking loose, and
there were constant wars of succession and military
revolts. But though often scotched it was never killed,
till an altogether new enemy appeared in the person
of Mulai Hamed, Sultan of Morocco, before whose
musketeers it was doomed to become extinct as an
independent kingdom. This happened in 1591, in the
reign of Askia Ishak. Ahmed Baba, the native historian,
who lived at the time, and was himself not only
a material sufferer, but a prisoner carried off to Morocco,
said of this terrible disaster: “Thus this Mahalla (or
expedition) at that period found in Sudan (Songhay) one
of those countries of the earth which are most favoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
with comfort, plenty, peace, and prosperity everywhere;
such was the working of the government of the Emir el
Mumenin, Askia el Hadj Mohammed ben Abu Bakr, in
consequence of his justice and the power of his royal
command, which took full and peremptory effect, not
only in his capital (Gogo), but in all the districts of
his whole empire, from the province of Dendi to the
frontier of Morocco, and from the territory of Bennendugu
(to the south of Jinni) as far as Zeghaza and
Tawat. But in a moment all was changed, and peaceful
repose was succeeded by a constant state of fear,
comfort and security by troubles and suffering; ruin
and misfortune took the place of prosperity, and people
began everywhere to fight against each other, and property
and life became exposed to constant danger; and
this ruin began, spread, increased, and at length prevailed
throughout the whole region.”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> If it be remembered
that this was written in Arabic by a Niger native
at the end of the sixteenth or beginning of the seventeenth
centuries about a negro sultan ruling over a
kingdom partly negro and partly Berber, the wonder of
it cannot but strike the thoughtful mind.</p>

<p>But in the Niger basin Songhay was not the only
centre of marvellous political and social development
under the influence of Mohammedanism. Bornu was
in every sense its rival. We have already seen that
towards the close of the eleventh century the king of
Bornu (Dunama ben Humé) had embraced Islam. The
result of the union of material power with spiritual inspiration
was soon made manifest, for before Ben Humé
died he had founded a vigorous empire whose influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
was felt as far as Egypt. It was not, however, till the
middle of the thirteenth century that Bornu rose to its
greatest power and the zenith of its glory under the
able rule of one Dibalami Dunama Selmami. At that
time Bornu, or, as it was sometimes called, Kameni (?),
which was then the seat of government, extended from
the Nile to the Niger, and from Mabina (Adamawa?)
in the south to Wadan in the north, according to Imam
Ahmed (1571-1603), the native historian of Bornu, as
Ahmed Baba had been that of Songhay. But Dunama
did not only increase the material power of Bornu.
Like Askia of Songhay, he encouraged religion, so that
“the true faith in his time was largely disseminated,”
according to Ebn Said (1282), an Arab writer.</p>

<p>After Dunama’s death troublesome times fell upon
the empire, and a long period of civil wars and disastrous
expeditions followed. Brighter times came back with
the ascent of Ali (1472) to the throne, and once more
Bornu regained its former grandeur. It is clear that
Ali’s kingdom extended far to the west of the Niger,
and became known to the Portuguese, who as far back
as 1489 show Bernu or Bornu on their maps.</p>

<p>Under the two succeeding reigns of Edris and Mohammed,
Bornu still further added to its importance, and
had relations with the northern sultans of Tripoli.</p>

<p>The most remarkable, however, of all the Bornu rulers
seems to have been Edris Alawoma (1571-1603), who
had the advantage of having a contemporary biographer
in the person of Imam Ahmed. This prince seems not
only to have been an enterprising and able warrior, but
was distinguished alike for mildness and justice, and for
far-seeing statesmanship. Under him the empire grew
to enormous proportions, and included almost the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
of the Central and much of the Western Sudan. At
the same time the country became more prosperous, the
wealth of the towns increased, and the Mohammedan
religion and education spread widely and rapidly.</p>

<p>Happily Bornu was established on a more stable basis
than Songhay. It had more cohesion in its various
elements, and was less dependent on the warlike character
of its rulers to keep it from falling to pieces. Its
princes also seem to have been of a better and more
liberal-minded stock. We even gather from the native
chronicles that they were “learned, liberal towards the
Ilama, prodigal dispensers of alms, friends of science and
religion, gracious and compassionate towards the poor.”
Hence it was that while Songhay and other states
rose and fell, Bornu retained its position and independence.
In the beginning of this century it experienced
a temporary eclipse before the conquering arms of the
Fillani in their mission of religious regeneration, but
only to emerge again as vigorous as ever, though now
restricted in its political influence to Bornu proper and
the immediate neighbourhood of Lake Chad.</p>

<p>But while Songhay and Bornu were for centuries
working out their remarkable political, religious, social,
and commercial development, they were, as we have
already pointed out, by no means shut off from intercourse
with the outside world. The thirst for the slaves
of Bornu and for the gold of Melli and the Upper Niger
was almost as potent a force with the later generations
of Arabs as was religious zeal among their ancestors.
For the one as for the other all the terrors of the desert
route were braved, and constant communication kept
up with the Sudan. At first Egypt seems to have been
the first point of departure of the Sudanese caravan, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
route passing westward to Songhay and the region of the
Upper Niger, while another diverged from it, and passed
south to the Chad basin. In later times Egypt gave
place to Tripoli as the starting-point, though practically
the same routes were utilised to reach the same goals.
At an early period also the most dangerous part of the
whole Sahara, that region, namely, lying between the
Upper Niger and Morocco, was traversed by indefatigable
Moorish traders for the sake of its slaves and gold.
The terminus of their route was at first considerably
to the west of Timbuktu, at a place called Biru or
Walata, where, indeed, nearly all the western trans-Saharan
traffic converged in the earlier days of commercial
intercourse.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the eleventh century Timbuktu
was founded as a trading station by the Tuaregs of the
Sahara, but it was not until it fell into the hands of a
powerful king of Melli some two centuries later that
it became a place of some importance. At once it developed
into an international market of the first rank,
where merchants from Egypt, Tripoli, Morocco, the
Saharan oases, and the Sudan met to exchange their
various articles of barter.</p>

<p>At no time was Timbuktu the capital of a great kingdom.
Its greatness solely depended upon its trade, and
its convenience as a collecting and dispersing centre.
That it should have become so well known above all the
places of the Sudan is easily understood if it be remembered
that it was the goal for which all the merchants
of Northern Africa aimed. Politically, Timbuktu was
thus raised to a position of undue importance, though
commercially, as the merchant capital, it could not be
overrated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>With the rise of the Songhay power Timbuktu became
subject to that kingdom. With the fall of the former it
assumed a measure of political importance as the centre
of Moorish power, till on the division from Morocco it
resumed its old status as nothing more nor less than a
trading centre, a position it has retained to this day.</p>

<p>Among a people of such commercial activity and
enterprise as the Arabs of Morocco, Tripoli, and Egypt,
naturally there were not awanting numbers of students
eager to collect and collate information regarding the
inland countries to which their merchants travelled.
Among the host of historians and geographers who
supply us with interesting facts, we may mention El
Bekri, El Edrisi (1153), Ebn Said (1282), Ebn Khaldun
(1382), and Makrizi (1400).</p>

<p>But the Arabs had their explorers as well as their
writers. Among these two stand out with marked prominence,
viz., Ebn Batuta (1353), and Leo Africanus
(1528). Ebn Batuta, who seems to have been devoured
with a thirst for travel, and had visited almost all the
countries of the then known world, commenced his Central
African explorations from Morocco, and crossed the desert
to Walata, the frontier province of Melli, situated not far
from the Niger. From Walata he crossed the Niger to
the capital of the kingdom, and thence by land proceeded
to Timbuktu. From Kabara, the “port” of Timbuktu,
he sailed down the Niger to Gogo, the capital of Songhay,
and thence turned northward again across the desert by
way of the oasis of Tawat to Morocco.</p>

<p>The travels of Leo Africanus were even more extensive,
for he travelled over the whole of the Central and
Western Sudan. Considering that he wrote an account
of his travels from memory many years after, the events<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
recorded, and the accuracy and amount of varied information
he gives regarding the countries he visited, are
astonishing. He describes not only the kingdoms of
Melli, Songhay, and Bornu, but also the countries that
lie between, Gober, Katsena, Kano, and Agades, of all of
which he has something important to say. Even when
he seems to draw most upon our credulity he is generally
quite correct, as for instance when he describes the
people of one district kindling fires at night under their
bedsteads to keep themselves warm. To the truth of
this statement the writer of these lines can testify from
personal observation, the precaution being adopted, however,
not to ward off external cold, but that of ague, a
disease to which many places on the Niger are subject
at certain times of the year.</p>

<p>It is not our intention to enter into the vexed question
of what the Arab writers and travellers knew regarding
the course and final destination of the Niger.
Those of them who travelled did not do so as geographers,
and though they noted accurately enough what they did
see, they troubled themselves very little with what they
did not see, and held aloof from inquiries of a purely
speculative character. M‘Queen<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> has made it clear,
however, that many of them were aware that the Nile
and the Niger were distinct, and that the general tendency
of Arab opinion was to make the latter river fall
into the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Much of the confusion as to what the Arabs did know
or believe arose largely from the ignorance of European
geographers in confounding the western kingdom of
Ghana with the central one of Kano, and of the town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of Kugha, near the Upper Niger, with that of Kuka in
Bornu. With the new light thrown upon the history
and geography of the Niger basin, we can now see that
the Arab writers had a wonderfully accurate conception
of the political and physical characteristics of the region
in question. To them is due not only the honour of
having raised the veil which shrouded the Sudan, and
spread the seeds of civilisation, which have flourished
so remarkably, but also of disseminating a knowledge of
that region among western nations&mdash;a knowledge destined,
as we shall see, to be caught up and carried to great
ends with European vigour and scientific accuracy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>OPENING UP THE WAY TO THE NIGER.</i></span></h2>

<p>With Leo Africanus the Arab period in the history of
African exploration practically closed. Even in that
traveller’s day the incurable diseases so characteristic
of the Mohammedan states of our time were rapidly
developing. Learning and the arts were no longer
encouraged. Liberality of thought and missionary
enterprise were replaced by Fanaticism, hatred of the
stranger, and isolation from all outside genial influences.
A blight was falling over everything that had made the
Arab name great and glorious in the world’s history.</p>

<p>Happily for the cause of progress, while the Crescent
thus waned and lost its lustre in the rising mephitic
fogs, the Cross was ever gathering to itself new glories,
and proving the herald and morning-star of a brighter
and greater era. Under its inspiring influences the
western nations were emerging from the gloom and
ignorance in which they had been enshrouded, and were
feeling the throbs of new heroic impulses.</p>

<p>Among the Christian nations thus awakening Portugal
was taking the lead. Facing the Atlantic, it was ever
looking over the wild waste of waters, picturing the possible
beyond on the blank expanse, and rearing a hardy
race of navigators all unconscious of the great mission
that was yet to be theirs. Southward, too, their thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
were ever turning, following their soldiers as they fought
against the Moors and planted their most Christian flag
along the entire coast-line of Morocco. Echoes there
were which came to them of the vast wealth of Inner
Africa, of the power of Prester John and the riches of
far Cathay, till the imaginations of kings, soldiers, merchants,
and priests were alike inflamed with a desire to
share them. With it all the vaguest ideas were current
as to the extent of the African continent. The northern
coast-line was well enough known, but at the beginning
of the fifteenth century no one had ventured southward
beyond the western termination of the Atlas Mountains,
and how much further south the land extended no one
pretended to know. This ignorance, however, did not
last through the century.</p>

<p>Under its energetic and far-seeing kings, John and
Immanuel, Portugal set itself to penetrate behind the
veil and attain the honour and the more substantial
rewards secured, as was believed, to those who should
first reach the sources of the gold supply of Inner Africa,
the capital of Prester John, or the countries of the Far
East.</p>

<p>Extensive voyages were then unthought of. Sailing
was very much a matter of feeling one’s way along the
shore. Hence it was not by any one extensive voyage,
but by many successive expeditions, that the shore-line
of Africa was gradually mapped out. In this way greater
courage, confidence, experience, and skill were gained with
each successful addition to the limits of the known, and
a spirit of emulation was aroused which irresistibly carried
the new knight errants of commerce and science
further and further south in search of the promised
land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1433 Cape Bojador was reached by Gilianez, and
the Island of Arguin by Nuno Tristan ten years later.
So far deserts and burning suns, a repellent coast-line
and a meagre population of wild nomads, were what
they found&mdash;no news of Prester John, no evidence of
the vast riches they had taught themselves to expect.
But nothing was allowed to damp their eager spirit or
quash their sanguine expectations.</p>

<p>In 1446 Fernandez passed Cape Verd, and in the
following year the fertile region of Senegambia was
reached by Lancelot.</p>

<p>It now seemed as if the bold adventurers were to
have their reward. They had at last arrived at a fertile
region abounding in gold and ivory, and, better still,
they began to hear of a great kingdom named Melli,
not then absorbed in the rapidly rising empire of
Songhay. This, they thought, must be the country
of Prester John.</p>

<p>These important discoveries, and all the glowing hopes
they developed, gave a new impetus to the course of
Portuguese discovery. With renewed enterprise and
persistence adventurous navigators pursued the path of
exploration. By 1471 they had reached the Gold Coast,
and before the close of the century the Cape had been
rounded, and, under the leadership of Almeida and
Albuquerque, some of their magnificent dreams of
wealth and power realised in the foundation of their
Indian Empire.</p>

<p>But though the Portuguese had thus revealed to the
world the Senegal and the Gambia, and apparently
thrown open a door to the kingdom of the Niger basin,
nothing came of it. From the writings of De Barros we
gather that embassies from the King of Portugal were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
despatched to the rulers of Melli and Mosi, and even,
it is said, to that of Songhay. Of these missions, however,
nothing more has come down to us. They added
seemingly nothing to our knowledge of the interior.
Factories were established along the coast, and even
some distance up the rivers Senegal and Gambia, but
the thirst for gold and slaves evidently swamped all
other considerations with the agents in charge, for not
an iota of information do we gather from them&mdash;or at
least none is now on record&mdash;of the geography of the
far interior.</p>

<p>The magnificent enterprise of Portugal in the fields
of maritime discovery was destined to be of the most
transient character. Evil days speedily came upon it,
and between Philip II. of Spain on land and the Dutch
at sea, it seemed for a time as if it would lose its place
among the independent nations of Europe.</p>

<p>From the time of its conquest by Spain its course was
backward, and its history became a record of shrinking
empire and gradual loss of all spirit that tends to national
greatness and progress. As far as we are concerned the
work of the Portuguese ended with the exploration of
the Senegambian Coast, the discovery of the rivers Senegal
and Gambia&mdash;then thought to be branches of the Niger&mdash;and
the revelation to Europe of the future route to
the Niger and Timbuktu.</p>

<p>The work of exploration so well begun, so magnificently
carried on, though so disastrously closed, began
now to fall into other hands. Contemporaneously
with the dwindling of the Portuguese into the background
the English came to the front. It was then the
Elizabethan period, that era of glorious memory, the
dawn of Greater Britain. Bold mariners, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
world has never seen, sprang up on all sides, and made
England the mistress of the seas. A spirit of commercial
enterprise and adventurous daring was developed
which nothing could dismay, nothing withstand.
Before the close of that eventful period Drake had led
his countrymen to the rich spoil of the Spanish Main,
Raleigh had laid the foundation of English rule in North
America, Baffin and Hudson had cleared the way for
Arctic exploration, and Davis had not only started the
series of heroic expeditions connected with the North-west
Passage, but had led English ships to the Indian
Seas.</p>

<p>With these, however, we have nothing to do. Of
more importance is it to us to note that Hawkins had
made his first voyage to the West African Coast, and
inaugurated that horrid traffic in human flesh and blood
which has left such an indelible stain on British
commerce.</p>

<p>But it was not only the slave trade which drew the
attention of English merchants to Africa. To them as
to the Portuguese the Niger and Timbuktu were words
to conjure with. Both were believed to be veritable
mines of wealth. To the imagination of the time the
one was pictured as flowing over golden sands, the other
as almost paved with the precious metal. It was believed
that the Senegal and the Gambia constituted the Niger
mouths, and accordingly that to ascend either river
would bring the traveller direct to the source of so much
wealth. To accomplish this now became the dream of
nations, so that it may well be said that the Niger
and its fancied treasures were the magnet which drew
men on to the exploration of the interior of the Dark
Continent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>It had been the mission of Portugal to draw a girdle
round Africa; it was now to be the <i>rôle</i> of Britain to
take up the work and penetrate inland with more lasting
results than had followed Portuguese embassies and
missionary and commercial enterprises.</p>

<p>The year 1618 saw the commencement of this noble
work. A company was formed to explore the Gambia,
with the object of reaching the rich region of the
Niger.</p>

<div class="center">

</div>

<p>The honour of being Britain’s pioneer in African
exploration fell to the lot of one Richard Thompson,
described as being a man of spirit and enterprise. He
left England in the <i>Catherine</i>, of 120 tons, with a cargo
worth nearly £2000, and reached the Gambia towards
the end of the year. Here he found the Portuguese
still in power, ruling the nations with grinding tyranny,
though rapidly sinking into the commercial and national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
apathy which has made them a byword in the nineteenth
century.</p>

<div class="center">
<img id="i_035" src="images/i_035.png" width="471" height="600" alt="Map: O. DAPPER, 1671." />
</div>

<p>Thompson’s enterprise, like so many which succeeded
it, was doomed to suffer sad disaster. First the Portuguese
fell upon and massacred a large part of the crew
while its captain was exploring up the river. Undismayed
he stuck to his post, and demanded reinforcements
and supplies. His employers were of like metal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
to himself, and promptly sent another vessel to his
assistance. The climate proved as formidable an enemy
as the Portuguese, and most of the crew of the new ship
succumbed to the deadly miasma.</p>

<p>Still another vessel was fitted out, its owners undaunted
by loss of men and goods, and sanguine as
ever of the glorious prize to be achieved.</p>

<p>This time one Richard Jobson took command. He
arrived in the Gambia in 1620, only to hear of a new
calamity and a new and even more paralysing source of
danger&mdash;Thompson’s men had mutinied and murdered
him. Portuguese hostility, a deadly climate, and mutiny
in the camp were all arrayed against the hoped for advance
into the country. But those old mariners were
made of stern unyielding stuff, which only death itself
could break, and undismayed Jobson defied all dangers
and started on his quest. With each succeeding mile
new difficulties beset the gallant band. No pilots could
be got to show the way. For a time this proved no
serious obstacle. Soon, however, the current grew
stronger, and threatened to drive them back. They were
in hourly peril from hidden rocks, and falls and rapids
raised a foaming barrier to further progress. Sand-banks
there were, too, on which they grounded, and
crocodiles had to be braved in getting clear of them,
while sea-horses snorted angrily and threatened to
swamp the boats. Unprovided with the mosquito-nets
of modern times, their days of overpowering fatigue
under a melting sun were followed by nights of maddening
torture under the stings of myriad mosquitoes
and sandflies. But everything was new and wonderful
to them. They were like children bursting into a new
world full of undreamed of marvels, a veritable land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
of enchantment. The voracious crocodiles and the
monstrous hippos in the river, elephants in troops
crashing irresistibly through the dense forest, leopards
watching cat-like for their prey, and lions disturbing
the silence of night with their awe-inspiring roars,
were some of the elements of this new wonderland.
There, too, were monkeys among the trees&mdash;their
gambols a never failing source of delight; and baboons
trooping through the underbush in enormous
herds, filling the air with strange outcries, except when
“one great voice would exalt itself, and the rest were
hushed.”</p>

<p>Not less astonishing was the insect life of the tropic
forest&mdash;the fireflies in myriad numbers flashing with
iridescent colours in the gloom of night, the crickets
raising their deafening chorus, the strange beetles, and
the many-coloured butterflies.</p>

<p>How marvellous, too, must the tropic foliage have appeared
to the explorers, fresh as they were from England.
The immense grasses, the almost impenetrable undergrowth,
the beauties of the palm tribe, the majesty of
the silk-cotton tree. Last, not least, how passing strange
the appearance of the natives, their comparative absence
of dress, their simple habits and rudimentary ideas about
all things under heaven. The modern traveller, <i>blasé</i> with
the rich heritage of a hundred predecessors, cannot but
envy the sensations of such an one as Jobson on seeing
for the first time all the marvels, beauties, and novelties
of Africa.</p>

<p>But while we vainly try to realise the feelings inspired
in the mind of this pioneer, we are not oblivious
of the terrible earnestness and determination, the indomitable
courage and dogged perseverance of the man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
The very devil himself has no terrors for Jobson.
Hearing certain remarkable sounds, and being told
by the natives that it is the voice of the devil, the
intrepid sailor seizes his gun and rushes forth to do
battle with his Satanic Majesty, who, on our hero’s
appearance, changes his terrible roars into notes of
terror, and shows himself as a huge negro grovelling in
the dust in an agony of fear.</p>

<p>On the 26th January 1621, Jobson had reached a
place called Tenda, where he heard of a city four months’
journey into the interior, the roofs of which were covered
with gold. Unhappily, however much his appetite
might be whetted by such wonderful stories, it had to
remain unsatisfied. The dry season soon began to
tell upon the volume of water in the river, making
advance daily more difficult, till within a few days of
a town called Tombaconda, some 300 miles from the
sea, he was compelled to desist from further attempts,
although he believed that Tombaconda was Timbuktu
itself, in reality distant about 1000 miles. On the 10th
February he commenced his return, hoping to go back
and complete his work with the rising of the waters, a
project he however never executed.</p>

<p>Quarrels broke out between the merchants on the
river and the Company, and the enterprise for the time
being collapsed.</p>

<p>It was not till nearly a century later that a new attempt
was made to prosecute the task of reaching the Niger
and the wealth of Inner Africa. In 1720, the Duke of
Chandos, acting as chairman of the African Company,
instigated a new expedition by way of the Gambia to
the land of promise.</p>

<p>This time the enterprise was placed under the leader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>ship
of one Captain Bartholomew Stibbs, who left England
in 1723, and arrived in the Gambia in October of
that year. His experiences were identical with those
of Jobson, though he did not reach the latter’s highest
point. Between them, however, it was made quite clear
that the Gambia had no connection with the Niger, and
as little with the Senegal.</p>

<p>With Stibbs ended the English commercial attempts
to open up the way to the interior of Africa.</p>

<p>The addition to our knowledge of its geography
amounted to the exploration of the navigable part of the
Gambia, and the determination of the fact that it had no
connection with the Niger.</p>

<p>The French meanwhile were doing for the Senegal
what the British were accomplishing in the sister river.
Six years after Thompson had entered the latter, the
French had established themselves at the mouth of the
Senegal and founded the town of St. Louis. Their first
exploring trip was made in 1637, when they penetrated
some distance along the navigable part of the river.</p>

<p>More important, however, was the expedition in 1697
of one Sieur Brue, director-general of the French African
Company, which achieved considerable success. This
expedition was backed up by a second voyage up the river
two years later, when the fort of St. Joseph was founded,
and trade opened with merchants from Timbuktu.</p>

<p>Sieur Brue’s experiences were in every respect similar
to those of Jobson and Stibbs on the Gambia, though
commercially more fortunate, inasmuch as he had to do
with more advanced races, and contrived to reach the
frontiers of a rich gold-bearing district (Bambuk) on the
one hand, and of an equally profitable gum region on
the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>He also heard much of the Niger and Timbuktu, and
seemingly satisfied himself that the Senegal had no connection
with the famous river of the interior, and that
the latter flowed east, not west, as it was the tendency
of his day to believe, since we find the French maps of
the eighteenth century showing the Niger flowing towards
the interior and an uncertain bourne.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>PREPARING FOR PARK: THE AFRICAN ASSOCIATION.</i></span></h2>

<p>The latter part of the eighteenth century marks the
commencement of the modern period of African exploration.
So far all African enterprises had been instigated
by governments for national aggrandisement, or
by merchants with commercial objects in view. Early
Portuguese discovery was a type of the one; the British
expedition to the Gambia an example of the other. But
now the time had come when, dissociated from both,
African exploration was to start forth on a new line of
unselfish research, and accomplish what governments and
commercial communities had failed in doing.</p>

<p>To the African Association belongs the honour of
inaugurating this new and more glorious era. Lord
Rawdon, afterwards Marquis of Hastings, Sir Joseph
Banks, the Bishop of Landaff, Mr. Beaufoy, and Mr.
Stuart, were the first managers of this Association,
whose objects were the promotion of discovery in Africa,
and the spread of information, commercial, political, and
scientific, regarding the still sadly unknown continent.</p>

<p>At first the Association devoted their attention to
Northern Africa, and in a short time were instrumental
in gathering together much reliable and valuable information
as to the Mohammedan states of that region.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Their inquiries, however, were not to be bounded by
the Sahara any more than the first onrush of the
Mohammedan torrent.</p>

<p>The routes of the large caravans to the Sudan were
made a subject of investigation, and the Arab writers
laid under contribution to satisfy the demand for more
light.</p>

<p>To the Niger especially their inquiries were turned,
in the hope of solving the mystery of its true position
and its course. Where did it commence and where
did it end? was the double problem which puzzled the
eighteenth century geographers more even than the
question of the source of the Nile.</p>

<p>Not content with inquiries which only landed them in
perplexities and endless discussion, they resolved to send
out explorers. To such they offered no monetary inducements,
no hope of tangible reward. The honour
and glory of discovery were to be their prize: the
Association at the same time undertaking, for their
part, to defray the traveller’s expenses.</p>

<p>The inducements offered were quite sufficient. Admirably
qualified men presented themselves in greater
numbers than were needed, so that the chief difficulty
of the Association was to choose rather than to seek.</p>

<p>The first of the heroic band of African pioneers was
Ledyard, already a traveller of the most varied experience.
His mission was to cross the African Continent
from the Nile to the Atlantic. At the threshold
of his enterprise he perished of fever in 1788.</p>

<p>Mr. Lucas was the next to take up the work. His
qualifications were an intimate knowledge of Moorish
life and language, gathered first as a slave in Morocco,
then as British Vice-Consul to that empire. The work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
marked out for him was to start from Tripoli and cross
the Sahara to the Sudan. In this he failed. A revolt
of Arab tribes barred the way, and Mr. Lucas abandoned
the enterprise, bringing back with him only additional
particulars regarding the interior, which he had gathered
from native merchants.</p>

<p>More successful in the earlier part of a succeeding
expedition was Horneman (1789), who undoubtedly
crossed the desert, but crossed it only to disappear for
ever.</p>

<p>Clearly Africa was a hard nut to crack, and dangerous
to whomsoever should essay it.</p>

<p>Foiled in their attempts to reach the goal of their
desires from the north, the African Association next
turned to West Africa for a possible opening to the
interior. Once more the Gambia was chosen as the
most direct and feasible route.</p>

<p>In Major Houghton they seemed to have got the
right man for the work. As Consul at Morocco he
had gained an acquaintance with the Moors and their
language, and at Goree, then in British hands, he had
come in contact with the West African negro, and
learned the conditions of life and travel obtaining in
the Gambia region.</p>

<p>The new attempt was made in 1791. Unlike Jobson
and Stibbs, the adventurous explorer did not proceed
by boat and with a large European party, but by land,
single-handed, and attended by the most modest of retinues.
At first all went well; no difficulties or troubles
retarded his progress. Generally following the course
of the river he safely reached Medina, the capital of
Wuli, and was hospitably received by the king of the
place. Less kind were the elements. A fire which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
reduced the town to ashes deprived him of much of
his goods. From Medina Houghton’s route diverged
from the Gambia, passing west to the Falemé, a
southern tributary of the Senegal, and frontier line of
the gold-bearing region of Bambuk. Here also he was
received with hospitality, and was sent on his way
through Bambuk rejoicing. Not to rejoice long, however.
The last communication received from him contained
these graphic lines: “Major Houghton’s compliments
to Dr. Laidley; is in good health, on his way
to Timbuktu; robbed of all his goods by Fenda Bukar’s
son.” No despair in these words, whatever calamities
might have befallen the writer; no halting in the resolution
to achieve his object&mdash;only the one unhesitating
determination to go forward. But it was to go forward
to die. In spite of Fenda Bukar’s son he seems still to
have possessed sufficient means to rouse the unscrupulous
cupidity of some Moors. Lured on by these wretches he
was led into the desert, where he was stripped of everything
and left to a horrible death.</p>

<p>It would seem that the disastrous ending of these
various expeditions had thrown a damper upon the
eagerness of volunteers to continue the work, for we
now find the African Association offering the inducement
of a liberal recompense to whomsoever would take
up the task broken off by Houghton’s death.</p>

<p>Little wonder if qualified men hesitated to offer themselves.
African fevers had a terror then which they no
longer possess. The continent was practically unknown,
and to the imagination, with no facts to act as correctives,
everything wore a terrible aspect. Cannibalism, general
bloodthirstiness and ferocity, a love of plunder, and all
manner of horrible practices, were associated with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
name of negro. Death by thirst or starvation was
thought likely to be the lot of those who escaped the
miasma of the land or the murderous spear of the
native. Brave indeed would be the man who should
face such an accumulation of vaguely discerned and
mightily exaggerated horrors.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the African Association had not long
to wait. At this crisis in their affairs the man for
the work was forthcoming, one destined to crown their
hopes with a triumphant success, to inaugurate a more
brilliant future for African travel, and give it such an
impetus as would carry it on to a glorious issue. This
was Mungo Park.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>MUNGO PARK.</i></span></h2>

<p>To continue our narrative of exploration we must now
leave the sweltering suns and miasmatic atmosphere of
Western Africa for the temperate climate and bracing
breezy hillsides of southern Scotland&mdash;turning from the
river dear to the geographer to the stream loved of the
poet&mdash;from the Niger to the Yarrow.</p>

<p>The man whose mission it was to break through
the isolating barriers reared by savagery and a deadly
climate between the land of the negro and all outside
humanising influences, must needs have an heroic
cradle, and come of an heroic race. His must be the
nurture of the Spartan, physically equipping him to
battle with hardship and privation&mdash;his the education
and upbringing which tend to all forms of noble discontent
and deeds of high emprise.</p>

<p>Such a cradle and such a race were Ettrickdale and
its peasantry. Theirs was the life of honest toil and
constant self-restraint, and theirs the direct and indirect
education which in the right man develops romantic
instincts, and weds to a perfervid imagination stern
religious convictions, intense practicality, and prosaic
tenacity of purpose. Theirs were the surroundings
fitted alike to mould the poet or the hero&mdash;him who
should sing of the chivalry of the past, or him who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
should be of the chivalry of the present, in whatever
field is scope for praiseworthy ambition and highest
aspiration&mdash;clear-sighted vision and undaunted courage,
dogged persistence and untiring perseverance, fortitude
under reverses, and physical powers to endure privation.</p>

<p>This, then, was the heritage which Ettrickdale had
to offer to her sons; and this, as one of them, the heritage
of Mungo Park, the first of the knight errantry
of Africa.</p>

<div class="center">
<img id="i_047" src="images/i_047.jpg" width="600" height="419" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BIRTHPLACE OF MUNGO PARK.</p></div>

<p>Of the early life of him who was destined to partially
unveil the face of Africa we know but little, though
that little is sufficiently significant and satisfactory.</p>

<p>Mungo Park was born on the 10th September 1771 in
the cottage of Foulshiels, some four and a half miles from
Selkirk. Foulshiels stands in the very centre of the love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>liest
scenery of the glen of Yarrow, facing on the opposite
side of the valley the stately tower of Newark. Eastward
it commands a view over the woods and groves
and “birchen bowers” of the widening dale to where
it merges in the valley of the Ettrick near Selkirk.
Westward it fronts a magnificent panorama of hill and
dale, through which curves the Yarrow in broken gleaming
reaches, from the wild romantic scenery of its loch
and mountain sources. To front and rear rise stately
hills, their bases separated and washed by the rushing
streams, their lower slopes clad with oak and fir, their
upper with grass and heather, over which the winds
sweep unopposed.</p>

<p>But if the surroundings of Park’s birthplace were
grand, the cottage, of which the ruins still exist, was
humble in the extreme. It was neither better nor
worse than might be tenanted by shepherds of the present
day in out-of-the-way places, being built substantially
of whinstone and lime, and containing at the most
three apartments. The building presents not a trace of
ornament, not a relieving cornice, thus fitly expressing
the character of its occupants, their extreme practicality,
their plain honest soundness and indifference to all
external graces. From such a cottage sprang a Burns,
and later on a Carlyle.</p>

<p>Mungo was the seventh child of a family of thirteen,
of whom, however, only eight reached the age of maturity.
By unremitting care and hard work his father had raised
himself to the position of a small farmer&mdash;how small his
cottage sufficiently shows. In him, however, we have
undoubtedly one of that type of Scottish fathers who
will pinch his own body and double the slavery of his
life in order that his children may receive a better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
education than he himself had, and that their minds at
least may not be starved and stunted. As Park’s first
biographer puts it, writing in 1816, “The attention
of the Scottish farmers and peasantry to the early instruction
of their children is strongly exemplified in the
history of Park’s family. The diffusion of knowledge
among the natives of that part of the kingdom and their
general intelligence must be admitted by every unprejudiced
observer; nor is there any country in which
the effects of education are so conspicuous in promoting
industry and good conduct, and in producing useful
and respectable men of the inferior and middle classes
admirably fitted for all the important offices of common
life.”</p>

<p>It would seem that there was no school near enough
to Foulshiels for the Park children in the earlier years
of their life to be able to attend, since we find a resident
teacher engaged to impart the necessary rudiments of
education.</p>

<p>With maturer years Mungo was transferred to the
Selkirk Grammar School, to which he probably walked
each morning.</p>

<p>From this time we begin to get glimpses of his peculiar
personality and character. It does not appear that he
showed any special talent while at school, though constant
in his attendance, and studious in application.
We gather that he was dreamy and reserved, a great
reader, a lover of poetry, and passionately fond of the
quaint lore and simple minstrelsy so markedly associated
with the border counties of Scotland.</p>

<p>His, clearly, was not the temperament which would
receive its guiding impulses from the routine work of
school or the precepts and instruction of schoolmasters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Such conventional influences would never have led him
to Africa. His inspirations were derived from the ballads
that were sung and the tales that were told by
every country fireside. For him the rushing Yarrow,
Newark’s ruined towers, the spreading field, the swelling
hillside, and the mountain top were teachers, each with
a tale to tell of bold adventure or of deadly strife.</p>

<p>The whole country was redolent with the romance of
the half-forgotten past, with a hundred memories dear
to a patriotic heart. In all around him there was something
to throw a glamour over his young eager mind,
something to fire his imagination and arouse eager
longings to be up and doing deeds undefined, yet ever
great and noble. From the stately castle, which now
looked down on him in melancholy ruined majesty,
brave knights of bygone days had ridden forth to fight
for king and country or for love. Their day was past,
but might not he in other guise emerge from his lowly
cottage, and with other weapons win his golden spurs.</p>

<p>In what way all these vague ambitions and this spiritual
fermentation was to end there was but small indication.
It is given only to the few to realise in after
life the romantic dreams of their youth.</p>

<p>At first it seems Mungo was destined by his father for
the ministry, but he himself preferred medicine, to which
choice no objection appears to have been made.</p>

<p>To acquire the rudiments of his medical education,
when fifteen years of age he was placed, as was the
custom of the time, as apprentice to Dr. Thomas Anderson,
a surgeon in Selkirk, a gentleman whose descendants
still practise the healing art in the same town. For
three years he remained with the Doctor, not only
acquiring a knowledge of medicine, but still further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
grounding himself in the classics and other branches of
education at the Grammar School.</p>

<p>Further than this we know nothing of his life in the
Anderson family, though that his time was agreeably
spent we may deduce from the fact that, as we shall see
later on, he some years after married Dr. Anderson’s
eldest daughter.</p>

<p>In the year 1789 Park left Selkirk for the University
of Edinburgh to complete his medical studies. Three
successive sessions seems to have been all that was
necessary to qualify in these days.</p>

<p>We are told that he was an ardent student, and distinguished
among his fellows. Botany was his favourite
subject, this fact being doubtless largely due to the
inspiring influence of his brother-in-law, Mr. James
Dickson, who from being a gardener had raised himself
by his own exertions to be no common botanist and the
author of some valuable and important works.</p>

<p>It was while still a medical student that Park came
more directly in contact with Dickson, and with him he
went a botanical tour in the Highlands.</p>

<p>Dickson did more for his young brother-in-law than
inspire him with a love of botany. He was on a footing
of considerable intimacy with Sir Joseph Banks, one of
the chief managers of the African Association, and when
Park left the University he introduced him to his influential
friend, and so brought him in contact with
the influences which were to make Mungo Park the
first of famous African travellers.</p>

<p>But the time was not yet. Park had still to prepare
himself practically for his great mission by widening his
experience of life and travel&mdash;had still to get further
bitten with the fever of unrest. Hence in 1792 we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
him sailing not to Africa, but to the East, as surgeon in
the East India Company’s service.</p>

<p>At this point he supplies us with an admirable and
characteristic glimpse of himself in a letter addressed to
his teacher in surgery and future father-in-law, Dr.
Anderson of Selkirk. The letter is dated London,
23rd January 1793, and the following is an interesting
portion:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I have now got upon the first step of the stair
of ambition. Here’s a figure of it. (A pen and ink
sketch is here given of a flight of steps with a man
on the lowest.) It very nearly resembles one of
Gordon’s traps which he uses in the library. Now,
if I should run up the stair, you see the consequence.
I must either be mortified by seeing I can get
no further, or, by taking an airy step, knock my brains
out against the large folio of some succeeding author.
May I use my little advantage in height to enable me
to perform the office of a watchman to the rest of mankind,
and call to them, ‘Take care, sirs! Don’t look too
high, or you’ll break your legs on that stool. Open your
eyes; you are going straight for the fire.’</p>

<p>“Passed at Surgeons’ Hall! Associate of the Linnean
Society! I walked three or four times backwards and
forwards through the hall, and had actually begun to
count the panes of glass in the large window, when
the bell rang, and the beadle roared out, ‘Mr. Park!’
Macbeth’s start when he beheld the dagger was a mere
jest compared to mine....</p>

<p>“I have purchased Stewart’s Philosophy to amuse me
at sea. As you are in Edinburgh, you will write to me
what people say of its religious character. You told me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
in Sandy’s (his brother Alexander presumably, who was
at the time following the medical course he himself had
just completed) letter that you would write me next
week. I have too much to say, and therefore must
speak by halves.</p>

<p>“The melancholy, who complain of the shortness of
human life, and the voluptuous, who think the present
only their own, strive to fill up every moment with
sensual enjoyment; but the man whose soul has been
enlightened by his Creator, and enabled, though dimly,
to discern the wonders of salvation, will look upon the
joys and afflictions of this life as equally the tokens of
Divine love. He will walk through the world as one
travelling to a better country, looking forward with
wonder to the author and finisher of his faith....</p>

<p>“<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I sail in about a month.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="caption">EXTRACT OF LETTER FROM MUNGO PARK TO DR. ANDERSON.</p></div>

<p>It was in this buoyant mood of the young conqueror-to-be
that Park looked forth upon the field of enterprise
opened up to him, and with Stewart’s Philosophy to
amuse him, and his deeply rooted religious convictions
to sustain him, left England for the Indies.</p>

<p>As showing the force of these convictions, we may
quote another letter, written to Dr. Anderson when on
the point of departure:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I have now reached that height that I can behold
the tumults of nations with indifference, confident that
the reins of events are in our Father’s hands. May you
and I (not like the stubborn mule, but like the weaning
child) obey His hand, that after all the troubles of this
dark world in which we are truly strangers, we may,
through the wonders of atonement, reach a far greater
and exceeding weight of glory. I wish you may be able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
to look upon the day of your departure with the same
resignation that I do on mine. My hope is now approaching
to a certainty. If I be deceived, may God
alone put me right, for I would rather die in the delusion
than wake to all the joys of earth. May the Holy
Spirit dwell for ever in your heart, my dear friend, and
if I never see my native land again, may I rather see
the green sod on your grave than see you anything but
a Christian.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Nothing noteworthy marked this voyage to Sumatra,
but his stay there was by no means wasted time, since
it afforded him an excellent opportunity of indulging
his scientific tastes, not as the collector merely, but also
and chiefly as the accurate observer.</p>

<p>A paper in the Linnean Transactions on eight new
fishes from Sumatra is sufficient evidence both of his
industry and of his scientific attainments.</p>

<p>Park returned to England after a year’s absence, and
was now ripe for the work in store for him. It nowhere
appears that so far he had even once thought of Africa
as a possible field for his ambition and energies. His
natural temperament, however, had been a fertile soil
for the romantic ideas which his early environment had
planted. His medical education had further fitted him
for the work of exploration, besides bringing him more
sympathetically in contact with his botanical brother-in-law,
who again was to bring him within the sphere of
influence of Sir Joseph Banks, and through him of the
African Association. Following these various determining
influences came the first taste of travel, the wider
experience, and the knowledge of the good and evil of
the wanderer’s life. All that remained wanting was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the golden opportunity to prove in action his potential
capacity for heroic service in the fields of geographical
research.</p>

<p>The return of Park from his first voyage was the
turning point in his career. At the moment there
was a crisis in the affairs of the African Association.
Everything they had attempted had ended disastrously,
and news had just reached them of the sad death of
Major Houghton. Should the task now be given up,
or was it to be resumed with renewed zeal and ardour?
There could be but one answer. The work begun must
be continued. Surely in the end it must be crowned
with success. Meantime, who was to take it up?</p>

<p>While the Association was thus inquiring for the man
fitted to entrust with their perilous venture, Park was
still undecided as to what course in life he was to pursue.
With Sir Joseph Banks as a link between, there could
not fail to be a speedy understanding and a mutual
settlement of the questions at issue for both. The
projects of the Association speedily came to Park’s ears.
Here was the very work he wanted, promising opportunities
to indulge in his love of travel and natural
history far transcending his wildest dreams. A splendid
prospect of a great work accomplished and glory won,
of difficulties surmounted and fame achieved, opened up
before him. Before such a chance there could be no
irresolution, no doubting, no fears. His course was
clear, and at once he volunteered his services, which
were, on the part of the Company, as promptly and
eagerly accepted as they had been offered.</p>

<p>Mungo Park was then twenty-four years of age.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>AT THE THRESHOLD.</i></span></h2>

<p>On the 22nd of May 1795, Mungo Park left England
on board the <i>Endeavour</i>, an African trader. On the
21st of the following month he landed at the mouth
of the river Gambia.</p>

<p>Bathurst, the present seat of government for the
Gambia basin, was not then in existence, with its present
busy European community and thriving native
population, its imposing public buildings and well laid
out streets. The native town of Jillifri on the north
bank, and a little way up the river, was the first place of
call in the early trading days of the Gambia merchants.</p>

<p>From Jillifri the <i>Endeavour</i> ascended the river to
Jonkakonda.</p>

<p>The view which opened up before Park as he proceeded
was neither attractive nor promising. The river flowed
seaward deep and muddy, its banks covered with impenetrable
forests of mangrove, forming when the tide
was out a horrible expanse of swamp. The air was
thick with a sickening haze, charged with the poisonous
exhalations from the fœtid mud engendered by heat and
moisture. Here and there only, a group of cocoa-nuts,
or an isolated bombyx (silk-cotton tree) relieved the
dreary monotony, and gave a momentary pleasure to
the eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p><div class="center">
<a href="images/i_060_large.jpg"><img id="i_060" src="images/i_060.jpg" width="600" height="349" alt="Map: MUNGO PARK’S TRAVELS. 1794-1805." title="Click for a larger version" /></a>
</div>

<p>Behind the mangrove swamps the country spread out
in a level plain, “very generally covered with woods,
and presenting a tiresome and gloomy uniformity to the
eye; but although nature has denied to the inhabitants
the beauties of romantic landscapes, she has bestowed on
them with a liberal hand the more important blessings
of fertility and abundance.”</p>

<p>At Jonkakonda, which seems to have been one of
the chief trading stations on the river, Park left the
<i>Endeavour</i>, and proceeded to the factory of Pisania, a
few miles further on.</p>

<p>In Dr. Laidley, the agent in charge, for whom he
brought letters, Park found not only a generous host,
but also a thoroughly competent adviser, and for several
succeeding months the merchant’s house and wide experience
were alike at his disposal.</p>

<p>The objects to be attained by his expedition were&mdash;To
reach the river Niger by such route as might be found
most convenient; to ascertain its origin, course, and
if possible its termination; to visit the chief towns in
its neighbourhood, but more particularly Timbuktu and
those of the Haussa country.</p>

<p>Park’s ardent enthusiasm was ever tempered with
the caution and prudent practical character of his
race. Like an old campaigner he set about learning
what was ahead of him, and otherwise preparing
for his difficult and dangerous task. The Mandingo
language had to be acquired, that he might come
into more sympathetic touch with the natives, and
be more independent of interpreters, ever a source of
profound danger, and often the greatest obstacle to
the advance of the explorer into unknown countries.
In addition inquiries had to be made regarding routes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the dangers to be avoided, and the general condition of
travel in these parts. Without such information it was
clear to him that he would be as a blind man walking in
a country beset with a thousand pitfalls.</p>

<p>But while thus preparing for his task, Park was
not oblivious to what was more immediately around.
We get glimpses of him making natural history collections
by day, and taking astronomical observations
by night. In particular he occupied himself in getting
up the details of the trade of the Gambia. Since the
time when Stibbs had ascended the river in the vain
hope of reaching the Niger, a considerable change had
come over the commerce of the region. The fancied
wealth of Timbuktu had not been tapped, but the commodities
of the countries within reach of the river had
proved no inconsiderable source of profit. In the year
1730 we find one factory alone consisting of a governor,
deputy-governor, and two other principal officers; eight
factors (hence the word factory) or trading agents, thirteen
writers, twenty inferior attendants and tradesmen,
a company of soldiers, and thirty-two negro servants, not
to speak of the crews of various sloops, shallops, and
boats. From that date, however, competition set in,
till at the end of the century the gross value of
British exports had fallen to £20,000.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that even in Park’s time the chief
article of export is slaves. Accustomed as we are in these
days to denounce in the strongest terms this vile traffic,
and to brand as the most degraded and brutal of their
race those who engage in it, it is difficult to realise that
less than a century ago we ourselves were the chief traffickers
in human flesh and blood. How little this horrible
trade touched the conscience of the individual or of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
country at large is sufficiently shown by Park’s own
narrative. We seek there in vain for a word of condemnation,
or the indication of a consciousness that
there was any iniquity in it. Not, be it noted, for
lack of knowledge of the attendant cruelties or even
through lack of pity for the victims. On the contrary,
he describes “the poor wretches while waiting shipment
kept constantly fettered two and two together, and employed
in the labours of the field; and, I am sorry to
add, very scantily fed, as well as harshly treated.”</p>

<p>Later on he accompanied a slave caravan on its way
to the coast. With simple naturalness he tells the whole
story of the horrors of the route, describing the fetters
and chains, the frightful marches, with heavy loads,
under a sweltering sun, and with starvation rations;
the whip mercilessly applied to the weary to stimulate
them to further exertions, and the knife placed to the
throat of the hopelessly exhausted, at once to rid them
of pain and their drivers of a burden&mdash;“an operation I
did not wish to see, and therefore marched on.”</p>

<p>He is quite aware that all these horrors are perpetrated
that a European market may be supplied. He
knows also what has preceded the slave path, and yet,
incredible as it may seem, not one indignant protest is
drawn from him, not one appeal to Christian Europe,
not even a word of commendation of the work already
inaugurated for its suppression. Quite the opposite, in
fact, on which point let Park speak for himself. “How
far it (slavery) is maintained and supported by the slave
traffic, which for two hundred years the nations of
Europe have carried on with the natives of the coast,
it is neither within my province nor in my power to
explain. If my sentiments should be required con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>cerning
the effect which a discontinuance of that commerce
would produce on the manners of the natives, I
should have no hesitation in observing that in the present
unenlightened state of their minds my opinion is,
the effect would neither be so extensive or beneficial as
many wise and worthy persons fondly expect.”</p>

<p>The wonder of the thing is intensified, to our mind,
when we reflect on the deep religious nature of Park,
his genuine kind-heartedness, his noble ambitions, and
his appreciation of all that is sweet in human nature.
The story is pregnant with meaning as to the influence
of our environment in opening or shutting our eyes to
what is going on around us.</p>

<p>But while Britain was then awakening to a sense of
its guilt, and preparing to purge itself of the unholy
traffic, we find from Park’s notes that a new trade,
destined to have almost as terrible consequences, was
already established. Europe, he tells us, took from the
Gambia chiefly slaves, and gave in return spirits and
ammunition. For over two hundred years the unfortunate
natives of Africa had been treated as wild creatures,
the lawful prey and spoil of the higher races. The
mother was tempted to sell her child, and the chief his
subjects. Village fought against village, and tribe against
tribe, that American plantations might be tilled. As
wild beasts and things accursed the negroes were shot
down in myriads, in myriads they perished on the road,
in myriads were transported to a life of shame and
misery. And now, when a new order of things was
about to be instituted, there had commenced another
hundred years of disgraceful commerce to complete the
work of brutalising the West Coast negro, of blighting
all elevating impulses, and suppressing all habits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
industry, transforming him into what he is to-day&mdash;the
most villainous, treacherous, and vicious being to
be found in all Africa.</p>

<p>Thanks to the slave trade in past centuries, and the
gin traffic in the present, our West Coast Settlements,
instead of being bright jewels in the imperial crown of
Britain, are at this day little better than standing monuments
to her disgrace. Happily the closing years of
this century are showing signs of an awakened public
conscience. Governments, companies, and private merchants
alike are taking a higher view of their responsibilities
to barbarous races, and before another half
century has come and gone we may hope to see the
vile monster badly scotched if not killed.</p>

<p>But while we gather from Park that in his day the
slave trade was carried on by British merchants without
a qualm of conscience, and that already gunpowder and
gin formed the staple articles of barter for human flesh
and blood, it is hardly less noteworthy that Islam was
steadily making its beneficent influence felt throughout
the whole land. He tells us that the inhabitants
were divided into two great classes&mdash;the <i>Sonakies</i> or
spirit drinkers, and the <i>Bushreens</i> or Mohammedans:
the former, pagans sinking deeper and deeper in the scale
of humanity under the degrading influence of European
intercourse and commerce; the latter ever rising upward,
adopting decent dress and decent behaviour, building
mosques and establishing schools, and specially attempting
to stem the flood of vile spirits poured into the
country by Christian merchants.</p>

<p>We have in a previous chapter alluded to the mighty
revolution produced by Islam in the Central Sudan.
Here we are only at the missionary outposts. Further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
inland, as we follow the footsteps of Park, we shall see
more and more of the good work Mohammedanism had
accomplished in Central Africa.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it was not all study and observation with
the young explorer. He had to go through a seasoning
process of an unpleasant nature. Having on one occasion
imprudently exposed himself to the night dew, he caught
a fever, and while recovering had a second attack, which
kept him a prisoner for some additional weeks.</p>

<p>Thanks to the care of Dr. Laidley no evil consequences
followed, while “his company and conversation beguiled
the tedious hours during that gloomy season (the rains):
when suffocating heats oppress by day, and when the
night is spent by the terrified traveller in listening to
the croaking of frogs, of which the numbers are beyond
imagination, the shrill cry of the jackal, and the deep
howling of the hyena&mdash;a dismal concert interrupted
only by the roar of such tremendous thunder as no
person can form a conception of but those who have
heard it.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>FROM THE GAMBIA TO THE SENEGAL.</i></span></h2>

<p>The time had at last arrived for Park to start on his
great undertaking.</p>

<p>In the beginning of October the Gambia had attained
its greatest height, or fifteen feet above the high-water
mark of the tide, and then had begun to subside rapidly,
so that by the beginning of November the river had sunk
to its normal level. This was the time to travel. The
natives had reaped their crops, and food was cheap and
plentiful. The rains were over, the land well drained
and dried, the atmosphere less moist and oppressive&mdash;all
of which circumstances combined to make travelling
more agreeable and infinitely more healthy.</p>

<p>At first Park had hoped to accompany a native
caravan going into the interior, but abandoned the idea
on finding that he would have to wait an indefinite
period for such an escort. He therefore determined to
depend on his own resources rather than lose another
good travelling season.</p>

<p>On the 2nd December 1795 he was ready for the
road. Accustomed as we are to read of the huge caravans,
the quantities of goods, stores, ammunition, and
instruments required by exploring expeditions to the
heart of Africa in these degenerate days, we cannot but
be surprised at the modest retinue and scanty <i>impedi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>menta</i>
which Park thought necessary for his great task.
His sole attendants were a negro servant named Johnson,
who had been to Jamaica as a slave, but being
freed had returned to his native country; and Demba,
a slave boy belonging to Dr. Laidley, who, besides Mandingo,
spoke the language of one of the inland tribes.</p>

<p>As beasts of burden Park had a small but hardy and
spirited horse for himself, and two donkeys for his
servants. As baggage he had provisions for two days;
a small assortment of beads, amber, and tobacco for the
purchase of fresh supplies as needed; a few changes of
linen and other necessary articles of dress; an umbrella,
a pocket sextant, a magnetic compass, and a thermometer.
For defensive purposes he was provided with
two fowling-pieces, two pairs of pistols, and some other
small weapons. Thus attended, thus provided, and thus
armed, Mungo Park started for the Heart of Africa&mdash;an
uncertain bourne only to be reached through deadly
perils and frightful miseries and hardships. How splendidly
equipped he must have been with the real necessaries
of the hero&mdash;unflinching determination, ardent
enthusiasm, Homeric resolve, and absolute self-reliance.
Thus provided with moral weapons and stimulants he
could rise superior to every difficulty and danger, and
emerge from the unequal struggle uncrushed, undefeated,
bearing with him not all, but much of the prize for which
he had staked life itself.</p>

<p>Besides Johnson and Demba, Park had the advantage
of the company of a Mohammedan on his way to Bambarra,
two slatees or slave-merchants going to Bondou,
and a blacksmith returning home to Kasson.</p>

<p>For the first two marches Dr. Laidley and two other
Europeans accompanied him on his way, feeling as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
they were performing the last offices for the dead, for
they never expected to see him again.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of December he took leave of these kind
friends, and turned his face inland towards the east and
the Unknown. As he rode slowly into the woods, after
breaking the last link which connected him with Europe
and civilisation, and took the road so lately traversed by
Major Houghton, he could not but recall that to the
latter it had been a road to death. Before him rose
up pictures of repellent waterless deserts, of trackless
jungles, gloomy primeval forests, and miasmatic marshes
which had to be penetrated before his eyes would rest
upon the river Niger. Only too clearly he saw the
dangers from man and beast which had to be faced
before he could ever hope to get once more in touch
with European civilisation. “Thoughts like these necessarily
cast a gloom over the mind, and I rode musingly
along for about three miles, when I was awakened from
my reverie by a body of people who came running up
and stopped my asses.” And with his reflections thus
broken by one of the innumerable annoyances of African
travel, they were not again resumed.</p>

<p>For the first few marches there was little to note
either in incidents of travel or in aspects of man and
nature. The scenery was pleasant, though but slightly
varied&mdash;gentle wooded acclivities everywhere, alternating
with cultivated interspaces surrounding towns and
villages. The inhabitants were Mandingoes, untroubled
by the trammels of clothes, Pagans for the most part,
and confirmed spirit drinkers; the rest Mohammedans,
respectable in character, decent in dress and behaviour,
lovers of education and religion, haters of strong
drink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>By both divisions of the community Park was hospitably
received, and treated to such simple fare and lodging
as they themselves possessed. With daily practice
the fatigues of the way became less harassing, while a
keen appetite, and the knowledge that absolutely nothing
else was to be had, made otherwise coarse food seem
palatable. Gradually a new standard of comfort was
formed on a scale proportionate to present possibilities,
so that at length positive enjoyment could be got out of
both food and lodging which previously would have been
deemed repulsive and miserable.</p>

<p>From the district of Walli Park entered that of Wuli.
At Medina, the capital of the latter, he was received
kindly by the king, who strongly dissuaded him from
proceeding further east into countries where the white
man was unknown, and where the fate of Houghton
might be his. But Park was not to be discouraged,
seeing which the king provided him with a guide to
take him on his way.</p>

<p>From Medina the route diverged from the Gambia,
and passed E.N.E. towards the Senegal. For some days
nothing special characterised the march. Everywhere,
however, the explorer gets interesting glimpses of the
life and ways of the natives, of their genius for story-telling
and their forensic skill, or of their love of wrestling,
an art in which they are such adepts that he
“thinks that few Europeans would have been able to
cope with the conqueror.”</p>

<p>At one place he finds that the men have a curious
way of administering disciplinary punishment to troublesome
wives.</p>

<p>Evidently in the huge feminine establishments of the
Mandingo husband the ordinary human hand is unable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
keep the women in due subjection and order. The unfortunate
husband with trouble in the house, and afraid to
tackle the offender or offenders in the ordinary manner,
has recourse to underhand ways. In every village a
masquerading dress is kept for the use of Mumbo Jumbo,
a mysterious person whose business it is to seek out and
punish wayward wives. When a husband finds matters
becoming too hot for him in his household, he secretly
possesses himself of this dress and disappears into the
woods. At nightfall frightful noises are heard near the
town&mdash;the signal that Mumbo Jumbo is abroad. Terror
falls upon every mutinous and erring member of the frail
yet troublesome sex, for no one knows on whom the
rod shall descend. None, however, dare to disobey the
summons, for now they have to deal with the devil himself,
backed up by all the male powers of the village.
For the men the occasion is a joyous one&mdash;though
not so for the women. All hurry to the meeting-place
to take part in the proceedings, and unite in
the active assertion of marital authority. But the
victim is not immediately pounced upon. The terrors
and uncertainties of conscious backsliders must be endured
for hours, cloaked beneath a well-simulated air
of innocence and careless gaiety. The time is spent
in songs and dances, as if to celebrate the coming detection
of the rebel and the triumph of order and the
principle of masculine rule. About midnight the witch-like
revelry ceases, and a frost of uneasy silence falls
upon the female throng. Who is to be the victim? The
next moment the question is practically answered, as
one of the number is seized, stripped naked, tied to a
post, and severely scourged amid the applause of the
crowd, loudest among whom are the ninety and nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
other women, each of whom a moment before had
thought herself a possible sufferer.</p>

<p>A similar spirit is not unknown in our own country
and times.</p>

<p>On the 11th December Mungo Park, without mishap
or discouragement, had reached Kujar, the frontier
town of Wuli, to the east.</p>

<p>Between Wuli and Bondou, the next country, there
lay a waterless wilderness, two days’ march in extent.
The guide from the King of Wuli had here to return,
and his place was taken by three elephant hunters.</p>

<p>At Kujar, Park found himself examined with an increased
curiosity and reverence, indicating a much less
degree of familiarity with the white man.</p>

<p>On the 12th the party started for the passage of the
wilderness, minus one of the guides, who had absconded
with the money he had received in advance. Before
proceeding far the two remaining guides insisted on
stopping till they had ensured a safe journey by preparing
a charm which would divert all danger from
them. The charm was simple enough, and consisted in
muttering a few sentences over a stone, which was afterwards
spat upon and thrown in the direction of travel&mdash;a
process repeated three times.</p>

<p>At midday the little party of travellers reached a tree,
called by the natives <i>Neema Faba</i>, which was hung all
over with offerings of rags and scraps of cloth to propitiate
the evil spirit of the place. This practice prevails
throughout the length and breadth of savage Africa,
though Park appears to have mistaken its meaning,
and thinking it due to the desire of travellers to indicate
that water was near, followed their example by hanging
on one of the boughs a handsome piece of cloth. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
the neighbouring pool, where they had proposed to
camp, signs of a recently extinguished fire made them
suspicious of the vicinity of robbers, and they therefore
pushed ahead to the next well, which they did not reach
till eight in the evening.</p>

<p>For the first time the dangers and difficulties of his
journey were brought vividly home to Park when after a
hard day’s work he and his party had to lie out in the
open, on the bare ground, surrounded by their animals,
and had to keep strict watch and ward for possible
attack. With daylight they filled their water-skins
and calabashes and set out for Falika, the western
frontier town of Bondou, which they reached before
midday.</p>

<p>In Bondou, Park found new aspects of nature and
other races of men.</p>

<p>For fertility the land was unsurpassed. Lying on the
parting ridge between the Gambia and the Senegal, it
was better drained than the country left behind, a fact
evidenced by the appearance of the mimosa. Towards
the east it rose into ranges of hills.</p>

<p>Far different, too, were the Fulah inhabitants. A
tawny complexion, small, well-shaped features, and soft,
silky hair, distinguished them at a glance from the negro
races around them. Among them Mohammedanism was
the prevailing religion, though not by any means exercised
intolerantly, “for the system of Mahomet is made
to extend itself by means abundantly more efficacious.
By establishing schools in the different towns, where
many of the Pagan as well as Mohammedan children are
taught to read the Koran, and instructed in the tenets
of the Prophet, the Mohammedan priests fix a bias on
the mind and form the character of their young disciples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
which no accidents of life can ever afterwards remove or
alter.” Of which latter fact let our Christian missionaries
take note, and if possible learn a lesson therefrom.</p>

<p>This remarkable race did not originally belong to
Bondou. Further south they were in even greater force,
though scattered in more or less independent communities
from Lake Chad to the Atlantic, a fact destined,
after Park’s time, to have the most important
bearing upon the history of the whole of the Western
and Central Sudan.</p>

<p>Everywhere Park found the Fulahs remarkable for
their industry, and no less successful in agriculture
than in pastoral pursuits, which seem to have been their
original speciality. In their hands Bondou developed a
degree of wealth unknown in neighbouring states. Its
prosperity, however, was also in great measure due to
its being on the chief highway of the commerce from
the interior to the coast, considerable duties being
levied on all merchandise passing through it.</p>

<p>At Falika, Park secured the services of an officer of
the King of Bondou as guide as far as Fatticonda, the
capital.</p>

<p>On resuming their journey a violent quarrel broke
out between two of Park’s companions, which would
probably have ended in bloodshed, but for the interference
of the white man, and his determined threat
that he would shoot down the first who again drew
sword&mdash;an ultimatum which had the desired effect.
The rest of the march was accomplished in sullen
silence, till a good supper terminated all heart-burnings,
and animosities were forgotten under the influence
of the diverting stories and sweet harmonies of an
itinerant musician.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 15th the party crossed the Nereko, a considerable
branch of the Gambia, and stayed for the night at
Kurkarany, a walled town provided with a mosque.
Four days later they crossed a dry stony height covered
with mimosas, and entered the basin of the Senegal.</p>

<p>They were now more within the sphere of influence
of French traders, who, as Park soon saw, had succeeded
with characteristic genius in suiting the taste of the
ladies of the country. These he found dressed in
a thin French gauze, admirably adapted for the hot
climate, and rendered dear to its wearers by the
manner in which it displayed and heightened their
charms. Their manners proved to be as irresistible as
their dress, so that Park found it impossible to withstand
their appeals for amber, beads, and other bits of
showy finery. Having despoiled him of all he had,
these “sturdy beggars” tore his cloak, cut the buttons
from his servant’s clothes, and were proceeding to other
outrages, when finding this more than his gallantry
could stand, he mounted his horse and fled, leaving
them disconsolate, but with abundant souvenirs.</p>

<p>Next day the Falemé, a turbulent tributary of the
Senegal, was reached. The natives were actively engaged
fishing, and the country around was covered with large
and beautiful fields of millet.</p>

<p>It was not without apprehension that Park on the 21st
December entered Fatticonda, the capital of Bondou.
His predecessor Houghton had here been plundered and
badly used, and he had every reason to fear a similar
fate. But the situation was not to be evaded, so he
braced himself up as best he might to face whatever
was in store for him.</p>

<p>On entering the town, he and his party took up their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
station at the Palaver House or Bentang, as is the
fashion of strangers, who thus make known their necessities,
and mutely appeal for a night’s lodging. They
had not long to wait before a respectable slatee invited
them to his house.</p>

<p>An hour afterwards a messenger came to conduct the
traveller to the king. Finding himself led out of the
town, Park began to fear a trap, but was reassured on
being shown the king sitting under a tree, and hearing
that such was his way of giving a private audience.
The stranger’s statement that he was no trader, and
that he only travelled from motives of curiosity, was
received with incredulity.</p>

<p>In the evening Park proceeded to make a more formal
call. First, however, he concealed some of his goods in
the roof of the hut, and donned his best coat, hoping
thus to save them from the possible plundering he might
be subjected to.</p>

<p>The king’s quarters were found to be converted into
a species of citadel by a high mud wall, having a number
of inner courts, each court containing several huts. After
threading a series of intricate passages guarded by armed
sentinels, the king, Almami, was at last reached. Again
he showed himself but half satisfied with the white
man’s explanations of the object of his visit. The idea
of travelling merely to gratify curiosity was too new
to his experience. It seemed the fancy of a madman.
The presents offered put him in good humour, however,
in particular the gift of a large umbrella.</p>

<p>As Park was about to take his leave, Almami stopped
him, and commenced a eulogium of the generosity and
immense wealth of the white men. From the general
he came down to the particular, and had much that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
flattering to say of his guest for the time being&mdash;a praise
soon directed pointedly to the traveller’s handsome coat
and shining buttons, until at length it became clear to
its owner that it was not only admired but coveted.
There was nothing for it but to take the coat off and
lay it at the feet of the wily monarch, who did his best
to console the giver by declaring that henceforth the garment
should be his state dress for all great occasions.</p>

<p>For once Park’s caution had overreached its object.</p>

<p>Next morning the traveller visited by request the
wives of Almami. He found himself surrounded by a
dozen young and handsome women, decorated with gold
and amber, who clamoured for physic and beads, and to
have some blood taken from them. They rallied him
upon the whiteness of his skin, which they said was
due to his having been dipped in milk when an infant;
and on the prominence of his nose, which they declared
had been pinched into that shape by his mother. Park
was equal to the occasion. He had compliments for all
of them. The glossy jet of their skin and the contours
of their <i>retroussé</i> noses, the bright glitter of their eyes
and brilliant whiteness of their teeth were alike praised.
This delicate flattery, with the addition of some bloodletting
and a quantity of drastic medicine, was irresistible;
and, though Park does not say so, undoubtedly
the good impression he left behind among the ladies
contributed materially to his immunity from the fate
of his predecessor. Not only was he not plundered,
but his baggage was not even searched. Still better,
Almami on parting gave him five drachms of gold.</p>

<p>On the 23rd the traveller resumed his journey in
the best of spirits after his unexpectedly good reception.
At mid-day a halt was called for rest and refreshment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
by way of preparation for the passage of the dangerous
district lying between Bondou and the next country,
Kajaaga, which it would be necessary to traverse under
cover of night.</p>

<p>As soon as the people of the village were asleep, the
donkeys were reloaded, and as silently as possible, so as
not to disturb the villagers, the party passed out into
the wilderness. The moon was shining brightly, illumining
their way. The air was perfectly still, raising
neither sigh nor rustle from leaf or bough. The
deep solitudes of the forest were undisturbed save by
the solemn impressive howling of wild beasts, and
shrieks and hoots of night-birds which mingled discordantly
with the deafening musical uproar of myriad
insects, and the clutter of innumerable frogs. Except
in whispers, not a word was uttered. Every one
was on the alert, at times guiding the animals, more
often peering ahead, or to right and left, on the lookout
for possible robbers. Happily no human enemies
appeared, though many were the alarms, as from time to
time an unusual sound, or the vaguely descried figure of
a prowling hyena, made each man seize his gun with a
firmer grasp. Towards morning a village was reached
where the little party were enabled to rest themselves
and their animals before entering in the afternoon the
country of Kajaaga.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>ACROSS THE SENEGAL BASIN.</i></span></h2>

<p>The further Park proceeded east the drier and purer
became the climate, and the more interesting the landscape.
In Kajaaga, lying between the Falemé and the
Senegal, he found a country everywhere interspersed
with a pleasing variety of hills and valleys, to which
the serpentine windings of the Senegal descending from
the rocky heights gave both picturesqueness and beauty.
The inhabitants, unlike the Fulahs, were jet black in
complexion, resembling in this respect the Joloffs nearer
the coast.</p>

<p>The people of Kajaaga are known as Serawulies, and
are noted for their keen trading propensities&mdash;at this time
chiefly directed towards supplying slaves to the British
factories on the Gambia.</p>

<p>On the 24th December Park entered Joag, the western
frontier town, and was there hospitably received by the
chief man of the place, officially known as Dooty or
Duté. The town was surrounded by a high mud wall,
as was also every individual private establishment.
Though the headman and the principal inhabitants were
Mohammedans, it appeared that the great mass of the
people were still Pagans, as was sufficiently shown by
the nature of their wild night revelries&mdash;“the ladies in
their dances vying with each other in displaying the most
voluptuous movements imaginable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>Park’s trials were now about to commence. During
the night a number of horsemen arrived, and after talking
with the host, took up their quarters in the Palaver
House beside the traveller himself. Thinking the latter
was asleep, one of them attempted to steal his gun, but
finding he could not effect his purpose undiscovered, he
desisted from the attempt. This, however, was but a
foretaste of coming trouble. It was easy to see that
Johnson was growing very uneasy at the aspect of affairs;
not without cause either, as very soon became evident.
Two of Park’s companions, who had been at a dance in
a neighbouring village, came in with the news that a
party of the king’s horsemen had been heard inquiring
if the white man had passed, and on being told that
he was at Joag, had immediately galloped off in that
direction.</p>

<p>Even while they were speaking the horsemen arrived,
and next moment Park found himself surrounded by
some twenty soldiers, each carrying a musket. Resistance
was useless; he could only wait in much anxiety
to hear his fate.</p>

<p>At length, after a brief interval, a member of the
party, who was loaded with an enormous number of
charms to ward off all forms of evil, opened their business
in a long harangue. The white man, they said,
had violated the laws of the country by entering it without
paying the customary duties, and had accordingly
forfeited everything he possessed. The soldiers had
orders to take him to the king by force if necessary.</p>

<p>Conceive the position Park was now in. Utter ruin
stared him in the face, and the collapse of all his cherished
schemes. To fight was out of the question. All he could
do was to try to gain a little time to think matters out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
and seek the advice of his companions and host. They
were unanimous in declaring that it would be disastrous
to him to accompany the horsemen. A long argument
with the spokesman ensued, by dint of which, and the
present of Almami’s five drachms of gold, the messenger
became somewhat mollified.</p>

<p>They demanded, however, to be shown the baggage,
from which they helped themselves to whatever they happened
to fancy; and having thus despoiled their victim
of half his goods, they left him to his gloomy reflections
and an indifferent supper after a day of fast.</p>

<p>Thus reduced in his already scanty resources, and his
power to travel correspondingly limited, Park found but
Job’s comforters in his companions. One and all they
urged him to turn back from his hopeless task. Johnson,
especially, laughed at the very idea of proceeding further,
miserably provided as they were. But the spirit of the
leader rose superior to his misfortunes, and he never
for a moment admitted the idea of retreat. While
strength remained there could be no flinching from his
task. Yet his thoughts were gloomy enough that night
as he sat reviewing his situation through the hours of
darkness by the side of a smouldering fire. Morning
brought no improvement to his position. The scanty
supper was followed by no breakfast.</p>

<p>What few articles still remained dared not be produced,
lest they too should be plundered. It was resolved,
therefore, to pass the day without food, trusting
to Providence for a stray meal sooner or later.</p>

<p>As the day wore on the pangs of hunger began to
make themselves felt. To allay this in some measure
the unfortunate travellers chewed straws, a make-believe
yielding as scant comfort as it did sustenance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
But Park’s faith in God was not belied. Towards
evening an old female slave passed by with a basket on
her head, and struck by his woe-begone, famished look,
she asked him if he had had his dinner. Thinking she
spoke in jest, he did not reply. Not so his boy Demba,
who volubly, and with the eloquence of suffering, told
the story of their misfortunes and their needs. In a
moment the old woman had her basket on the ground,
and a plentiful supply of ground-nuts was placed in
their hands, the donor thereafter marching away without
waiting for a word of thanks.</p>

<p>Further good fortune was now in store for them. It
happened that Demba Sego Jalla, the Mandingo king
of Kasson further east, had sent his nephew to the King
of Kajaaga to try to arrange some disputes which were
threatening to lead to war. The embassy, however, had
met with no success. Returning homeward, the king’s
nephew had heard of there being a white man at Joag
who was desirous of visiting Kasson, and curiosity
brought him to see the stranger. On hearing Park’s
story, the young noble offered him his protection all
the way&mdash;an offer that was eagerly and gratefully
accepted.</p>

<p>Thus guided and protected, Park set out for Kasson
on the 27th. Some distance on the way Johnson, in
spite of his life in Jamaica and his seven years’ residence
in England, showed that he still was saturated with the
superstitious ideas of his youth by producing a white
chicken and tying it by the leg to a particular tree as
an offering to the spirits of the woods. The same belief
in nature spirits has already been alluded to in a previous
chapter. Anthropologists tell us that it must at
one time have been universal, and evidences of it are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
found not only in the charming legends of the Greeks,
with their nymphs of meadow, grove, and spring, and
dryads growing with the oaks and pines, but also in
our own Anglo-Saxon words.</p>

<p>In the evening the party safely arrived at Sami, on
the banks of the Senegal. Park describes the sister
river to the Gambia as being at this point a beautiful
but shallow stream, flowing slowly over a bed of sand
and gravel. The banks are high and covered with verdure,
and are backed by an open cultivated country, the
distant hills of Felow and Bambuk adding an additional
beauty to the landscape. A few miles below Sami
was the former French trading station of St. Joseph,
founded by Sieur Brue, but abandoned in the time
of Park. Next morning the party proceeded a little
further up the river to Kayi, where they crossed with
no small difficulty and danger, the animals being swum
over, and the baggage conveyed in a miserable canoe.</p>

<p>While Park was crossing by the same means the canoe
was capsized by an injudicious movement on the part of
his protector, but being near the bank, no harm came of
it, and a second attempt landed him safely in the country
of Kasson.</p>

<p>The young noble, having once brought the white
traveller into his own country, soon showed that no
generous motives had prompted his assistance. Unhesitatingly
he demanded a handsome present. Park,
seeing that it was useless either to upbraid or to complain,
with a heavy heart made the necessary selection
from his scanty stock of goods, and presented the offering
forthwith.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 29th the party reached Tisi,
where Park was lodged with his protector’s father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Tiggity Sego, the head man of the place. Next morning
a slave having run away, the use of Park’s horse was
asked for the chase, to which he “readily consented,
and in about an hour they all returned with the slave,
who was severely flogged, and afterwards put in irons.”</p>

<p>Park was detained for several days at Tisi, while his
horse was further used by his host on a more extended
mission. During his enforced detention our traveller
had an opportunity of seeing a somewhat more drastic
method of propagating Islam than any he had yet witnessed.
An embassy of ten persons arrived from the
King of Futa Larra, a country to the west of Bondou,
and announced to the assembled inhabitants that unless
all the people of Kasson embraced the Mohammedan
religion, and evinced their conversion by saying solemn
public prayers, he, the King of Futa Larra, would certainly
join his arms to those of Kajaaga.</p>

<p>Such a coalition would have been disastrous to Kasson,
and without a moment’s hesitation the conversion was
agreed to. Accordingly, one and all did as was desired,
offering up solemn prayers in token that they were no
longer Pagans, but followers of Mohammed.</p>

<p>It was not till the 8th of January 1796 that Demba
Sego, the young noble, returned with the traveller’s horse,
whereupon Park, impatient at the delay, declared that
he could spend no more time at Tisi, and must proceed
to the capital. He was informed he could not do so
until he had paid the customary trading duties. Some
amber and tobacco were offered, but they were laid aside
as totally inadequate for a present to a man of Tiggity
Sego’s importance. Once more Park had to submit to
seeing his baggage ransacked. One-half he had already
lost at Joag, and now half of what remained had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
be similarly sacrificed to satisfy the rapacity of his tormentors.</p>

<p>Thus despoiled, Park was permitted to depart next
morning. His course, which so far had been E.N.E., was
now E.S.E. In the afternoon the party arrived at the
village of Jumbo, the birthplace of the blacksmith who
had faithfully accompanied Park from Pisania. The
entire population turned out to welcome back their
townsman with dance and songs. The poor fellow’s
meeting with his blind mother was most touching. Unable
to see him, she stretched out her arms to welcome
him, and after eagerly satisfying herself by touch of
face and hands that it was indeed her son who had
returned, she gave wild expression to her delight. From
which Park concludes, “that whatever differences there
are between the Negro and the European in the conformation
of the nose and the colour of the skin, there is
none in the genuine sympathies and characteristic feelings
of our common nature.”</p>

<p>This affectionate welcome over, the villagers had time
to turn their attention to the white man. At first they
looked or affected to look upon him as a being dropped
from the clouds, the women and children shrinking
from him half in fear, half in awe. On being assured
by their countryman that he was a good-tempered and
inoffensive creature, they gradually laid aside their misgivings,
and began to feel the texture of his clothes, and
assure themselves that he was indeed cast in much the
same mould as themselves. Still his slightest movement
was sufficient to arouse their tremors and make
them scamper off like a flock of sheep which had
valorously marched up to view a sleeping dog.</p>

<p>Next day Park continued his journey to a place called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Sulu, where he had an order from Dr. Laidley on a slatee
for the value of five slaves. Hardly had he been hospitably
received by Dr. Laidley’s client, when messengers
arrived from Kuniakary with orders that he should
proceed at once to the king. Thither accordingly he
journeyed, arriving late in the evening.</p>

<p>The rule of “like master, like man” did not hold
good in relation to the King of Kasson and such of his
subordinates as Park so far had come in contact with.
His reception by one whose “success in war and the
mildness of his behaviour in times of peace had much
endeared him to his subjects,” was an agreeable variation
to the hard fate which had lately dogged his footsteps.
The king was not only satisfied with his visitor’s
story and his poor present, but promised him every
assistance in his power. He warned him, however, that
the road to Bambarra was for the time being rendered
extremely dangerous, if not altogether impassable, by the
outbreak of war between that state and the adjoining
one of Kaarta. In the hope of the arrival of more reassuring
news Park waited four days, staying the while
with the Sulu slatee, from whom he received gold dust
to the value of three slaves. This transaction coming to
the ears of the king, Park was compelled to add considerably
to the value of his former present.</p>

<p>The country around Sulu presented an enchanting
prospect of simple rural plenty, while the scenery surpassed
in richness and variety any Park had yet seen.
The density of the population was illustrated by the fact
that the King of Kasson could raise within sound of his
great war drum an army of four thousand fighting men.
The one drawback to the amenities of the place was the
numerous bands of wolves and hyenas which nightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
attacked the cattle, and were only to be driven off by
organised parties of men with fires and torches.</p>

<p>From Sulu, Park proceeded S.E. up the rocky valley
of the Kriko, meeting everywhere swarms of people
leaving the expected seat of war in Kaarta.</p>

<p>On the 8th he left the charming valley of the Kriko,
and travelled over a rough stony country to the ridge
of hills which forms the boundary-line between Kasson
and Kaarta. Thence his way lay down a stony precipitous
path into the dried-up bed of a stream, whose
overarching trees afforded to the wayfarer a grateful
shade. Emerging from this romantic glen, the party
found itself on the level sandy plains of Kaarta, having
the hilly ranges of Fuludu on their right.</p>

<p>On the third day from Sulu, Park witnessed a new
method of consulting the Oracle as to the fate in store
for them on the road. To his great alarm, their guide,
who was a Mohammedan in name and a Pagan at heart,
came to an abrupt standstill in a dark lonely part of a
wood. Taking a hollow piece of bamboo he whistled
very loud three times. Thereafter he dismounted, laid
his spear across the pathway, and again whistled thrice.
For a short time he listened as if for an answer, and
receiving none, told Park that now they might proceed,
for the way was clear of danger.</p>

<p>Next day the superstitious ideas cherished by the
natives were further illustrated. Park had wandered
some distance from his party, when, just as he reached
the brow of a slight eminence, a couple of negro horsemen
galloped from the bushes. Immediately on seeing
each other Park and the negroes alike came to an abrupt
stop, each equally filled with alarm. The white man was
the first to regain his presence of mind, and concluding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
that advance was his safer course, he moved towards them.
This was too much for the terrified natives, who thought
they saw in the strange figure before them some terrible
spirit. One of them, with a wild look of horror, turned
and fled; the other, paralysed beyond action, could only
cover his eyes and mutter his prayers. In this position
he would have remained stationary, but for the instinct
of his horse, which led him to follow his companion.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 12th, Park and his party
entered the capital of Kaarta. On announcing their
arrival to the king, a messenger was sent to convey them
to a hut and protect them from the inquisitive crowd.
In carrying out the latter part of his commission the
messenger signally failed, and for the rest of the afternoon
our explorer remained on exhibition, the hut being
filled and emptied thirteen times by an admiring and
curious mob.</p>

<p>In the evening his majesty gave Park an audience,
seated on a clay divan raised a couple of feet above
the floor, and covered with a leopard’s skin, the sign of
authority. The way to the throne lay through a long
lane formed by a huge crowd of fighting men on the one
side, and of women and children on the other.</p>

<p>The reception of the stranger was highly encouraging.
He was told, however, that he had chosen a most inopportune
time to attempt to pass into Bambarra, and he was
advised to return to Kasson, and there await the end of
the war just commencing. That, however, meant the
loss of the dry season, and Park dreaded the thought
of spending the rainy season in the interior. “These
considerations, and the aversion I felt at the idea of
returning without having made a greater progress in
discovery, made me determined to go forward.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>Hearing this determination, the king showed his
kindly intentions by pointing out that there was another&mdash;though
a more dangerous and circuitous route&mdash;to
Bambarra, namely, that by way of Ludamar, an Arab
district to the north-west of Kaarta. At the same time
he promised to give the white man guides for this route
as far as Jarra, his frontier town. With this offer Park
only too gladly closed.</p>

<p>Before the audience ended a horseman arrived in
foaming haste to announce that the Bambarra army
had left Fuludu for Kaarta.</p>

<p>Next morning, after Park had sent his horse-pistols
and holsters as a present to his royal host, a large escort
was provided to protect and lead him on his way to
Ludamar.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>TO LUDAMAR.</i></span></h2>

<p>It must have been with no pleasant sensations that Park
turned aside from his direct route E.S.E. to the Niger,
and proceeded north instead to Ludamar. In addition
to the increased distance, there were the hundredfold
greater dangers to be encountered. Houghton had preceded
him over the same road, with what results his
successor only too well knew. And yet, as matters
turned out, it was perhaps as well that he elected to
try his fate by the more circuitous route. Before many
days were over Kaarta was desolated by the Bambarra
army, which only retired laden with spoil on finding that
the last refuge of the king could neither be stormed nor
reduced by starvation. The trouble of the Kaartans
did not end with the war with Bambarra, for they fell
out with the people of Kasson, and before the year was
ended had to face a coalition of various enemies.</p>

<p>On the 13th February Park started for Ludamar. His
escort of over two hundred horsemen seems to have been
of little use, for in the evening the hut in which his
luggage was deposited was entered, and some of his
rapidly diminishing stores stolen. Next day he came
upon some negroes gathering the fruit of the <i>Rhamnus
lotus</i>, which being converted into a species of bread,
forms no inconsiderable addition to the food of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
natives of Kaarta and Ludamar. This shrub, Park does
not doubt, is the lotus mentioned by Pliny as the food
of the Libyan Lotophagi.</p>

<p>The increased dangers of the new route were amply
illustrated as Ludamar was approached. Bands of marauding
Moors were taking advantage of the unsettled
state of the country to carry off cattle with impunity.
At one town Park saw five Moors calmly select sixteen
of the finest oxen of a herd, and in the presence of five
hundred negroes drive them away without even a show
of resistance. One young man who had been out in
the fields, and had shown more courage, had been shot,
and was brought in dying. His mother, frantic with
grief, filled the air with her shrill shrieks and lamentations,
clapping her hands the while. “He never told a
lie” was the astonishing encomium passed upon him, a
phenomenal occurrence in a continent where lying is a
virtue, and the art is raised to its utmost perfection.
On being assured that all hope of saving the boy’s life
was gone, some good Mohammedans did their best to
ensure him&mdash;though hitherto a Pagan&mdash;a place in Paradise,
by getting him to repeat the sacred formula of Islam,
in which pious effort they happily were successful.</p>

<p>On the 17th, Park, in company with numbers of people
flying from the terrors of war, travelled during the night,
to escape the more immediate danger of Moorish robbers.
After resting during the early morning, they resumed
their journey at daybreak. Two hours later they passed
Simbing, from which Houghton had despatched the
graphic letter, already quoted, telling of his destitute
condition, but unalterable intention of proceeding to
Timbuktu. At noon, Jarra, the southern frontier
town of Ludamar, was reached. It was from this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
place that Park’s predecessor was decoyed into the
desert by Moors, and after being stripped, was left
either to die of starvation or be murdered by passing
ruffians, a point never satisfactorily cleared up, though
Park was shown the spot where he breathed his last.</p>

<p>At Jarra, Park was hospitably received by a Gambia
slatee, who had borrowed goods from Dr. Laidley to the
value of six slaves, for which debt Park was provided
with an order. The debt was acknowledged, but the
merchant pleaded inability to pay more than two slaves.</p>

<p>Our traveller had now entered a more inhospitable
region. Ludamar was found to be inhabited by negroes,
an Arab race largely intermixed with negro blood forming
the rulers and possessing the worst characteristics of
both sides of descent.</p>

<p>Park and his attendants were not long in experiencing
the brutal and inhospitable character of this degraded
hybrid people.</p>

<p>Difficulties had met them at every step of their journey,
and now nothing but new terrors loomed up before them.
So great did these seem, and so overbearing and threatening
was the attitude of the Moors, that Park’s servants
declared they would rather lose everything they possessed
than proceed further. Not only were they liable to
robbery and ill-usage, but not improbable to slavery also.
These facts were so patent that, though unwavering in
his own determination to push on, Park could not bring
himself to force his men to follow him. Accordingly
he made arrangements for parting with them. Among
other things, he prepared duplicates of his papers to put
into the hands of Johnson. Meanwhile a messenger
had been sent to Ali, chief of the country, to ask permission
to pass through his country to Bambarra. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
request was accompanied by a present of fine garments
of cotton cloth which Park purchased from the slatee in
exchange for his fowling-piece. Fourteen days elapsed
before an answer was returned, and then he was told to
follow Ali’s messenger to Gumba.</p>

<p>On preparing to depart, hopeful as ever that yet he
should live to see the Niger, he was further cheered by
the fidelity of his boy Demba, who seeing his master was
not to be dissuaded from his determination to proceed,
resolved not to desert him, whatever might be the result.
It then came out that Johnson, whose residence among
Europeans had only served to corrupt him, had treacherously
tried to seduce Demba to return with him and
leave the white man to his fate.</p>

<p>To diminish the inducements to plunder, Park, before
starting, left as many of his personal effects behind him
as he could spare. For two days the little party toiled
over a sandy country. On the third day they reached
Dina, a large town built of stone and clay. The reception
Park here met with at the hands of the natives was
atrocious. Every opprobrious epithet which their vocabulary
could supply was hurled at him. Not content with
words, they proceeded to spit upon and otherwise heap
ignominy upon the stranger, ending by tearing open
his bundles and helping themselves to whatever they
had a mind. For the victim of these outrages there
was nothing but patience and resignation, with which
virtues, indeed, he seems to have been amply endowed.
He might be robbed of his material resources, but his
spiritual stores remained untouched. With him, while
there was life there was hope.</p>

<p>Not so with his servants. They had no magnet to
draw them on, no higher impulse than monetary reward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
Further forward they would not go. So be it! Their
retreat was excusable, but <i>Onward</i> must be their
master’s watchword so long as any pencil of light glimmered
through a loophole&mdash;<i>Onward</i> as long as limbs
and strength and hope held out.</p>

<p>Not daring to face another day of insult and plunder,
nor yet a night of gloomy reflection, Park gathered
together such valuables as he could carry, left the village
under cover of darkness, and with magnificent resolution
started alone on his forlorn hope of reaching the
Niger.</p>

<p>As the huts disappeared behind him, the moon shone
out bright and clear in the heavens, filling the night
with its mellow beauty, both literally and figuratively
lighting up the dark path before him.</p>

<p>From all sides came the roar of wild beasts, adding
to the terrors of the situation. Undismayed, however,
and still unwavering, he plodded onward through the
night. He had not proceeded far when a clear halloo
stopped his resolute footsteps. The accents sounded
familiar, and in a few moments more he was joined by
his faithful servant Demba. Park then found that the
boy had made up his mind to stand by him, though
Ali’s messenger returned to his master.</p>

<p>The little party of two now continued their journey,
travelling steadily on over a sandy country covered with
asclepias. At midday they reached a few huts, but
were prevented from drawing water from the village
well by the appearance of a lion. They therefore had
to endure the pangs of thirst with patience till the evening,
when they entered a town occupied by Fulahs.
Park now seemed to have touched the bottom of his
misfortunes. For several days he proceeded unmolested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
through Ludamar, each new day, each mile nearer his
goal, filling his sanguine mind with brighter and fresher
hopes.</p>

<p>On the 5th March he reached Dalli. The villagers,
hearing that a white man had arrived, deserted the
revelries attendant on a feast, and hastened to see the
phenomenal stranger. Not pell-mell, however, like the
rude mob of Dina, but in a decorous procession, and
headed by flute-players, as if they felt themselves
honoured by the visit. Round Park’s hut they continued
to dance and sing till midnight, during which
time he had to keep himself continuously on exhibition
to satisfy their simple and kindly if somewhat overwhelming
curiosity.</p>

<p>Next day Park moved on to a village to the east of
Dalli to escape the crowd which usually assembled there
in the evening. Again his reception was most hospitable.
The head man considered himself highly distinguished
by having such a guest in his house, and showed
it practically by killing two fine sheep to feast him and
his own friends.</p>

<p>Park was now only two days from Gumba, the
first town of Bambarra. He had but to reach that
place to be safe from the thieving and brutal half-caste
Moors, whose rule of the unhappy negroes was but
another name for rapine and plunder. His hopes were
high that now the success of his mission was almost
assured. In fancy he saw himself already on the bank
of the Niger, which he had come so far and suffered so
much to see. His imagination revelled in a thousand
delightful scenes in his future progress.</p>

<p>Thus buoyed up with glowing thoughts, he abandoned
himself with unrestrained gaiety to the harmless festivi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>ties
organised by his negro host, whose manners were in
striking contrast to his experience of those of the Ludamar
Moors.</p>

<p>But just when his golden dream was at its brightest,
it was shattered by a rude awakening. Messengers
arrived from Ali with orders to convey the white man
either peaceably or by force to his camp at Benaun.
Park was struck dumb with painful emotions, though
slightly relieved on hearing that the sole cause of his
being taken back was the curiosity of Fatima, Ali’s
favourite wife. That lady’s desire to see a white man
being satisfied, the chief promised that he should be
conveyed safely on his way to Bambarra.</p>

<p>There was no gainsaying Ali’s orders, and argument
was of no avail. Once more Park must fall back on
his patience and his hope. Now practically prisoners,
he and his faithful boy Demba were carried back to
Dina, where his reception had already been so brutal.
Here he was brought before one of Ali’s sons, who soon
gave him a taste of the dangers and indignities in store
for him. Barely was he seated when a gun was handed
to him, and he was told to repair the lock and dye
the stock blue. Knowing nothing of such matters,
Park could only declare his ignorance. He was then
ordered to produce his knives and scissors, and hand
them over to the young tyrant. On Demba attempting
to explain that they had no such articles, their tormentor
sprang up in a fury, seized a musket, and was
about to blow out the poor boy’s brains, when the bystanders
interfered and saved his life.</p>

<p>After this unpleasant incident master and man beat
a hasty retreat from the hut, and it is little to be
wondered at that the latter tried to escape altogether.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>Next day the prisoners were conveyed to Benaun, the
headquarters of the paramount chief of Ludamar, under
a terrible sun, and over burning sands. They travelled
all day with almost no water, the pangs of thirst being
slightly alleviated by the use of gum, which keeps the
mouth moist and allays the pain in the throat. In the
evening they arrived at their destination, a temporary
camp, consisting of a great number of dirty-looking
tents scattered without order, among which were large
herds of camels, cattle, and goats. At the outskirts
of the camp, Park, by much entreaty, procured a little
water.</p>

<p>The arrival of the white traveller was the signal for a
great commotion. Women hastened from their domestic
avocations and forsook their waterpots at the well. The
men mounted their horses&mdash;every one came running or
galloping helter-skelter, amid wild screaming and shouting.
In a ferocious mob they surrounded the unhappy
cause of their excitement, pouncing upon him like a
pack of hyenas, tugging and pulling his clothes, threatening
him with all sorts of penalties if he would not
acknowledge the One God and His Prophet. In this
sad plight, half dead with the pangs of thirst and the
fatigues of a desert march, he was hustled and pulled
towards the chief’s tent. When at last he found himself
in the presence of the great man, a single glance at
his face was sufficient to dispel the last hope of better
treatment. Ali was an old man, with an Arab cast of
countenance, on whose every lineament were marked
sullenness and cruelty. While he passively examined
the unfortunate man before him, the women of his
household were more actively engaged inspecting the
dress of the victim and searching his pockets. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
affected to doubt that he was a man at all, and counted
his fingers and toes to assure themselves that he was
indeed like themselves. Not content even with that,
they must needs have a peep at his white skin, and
pushed aside his garments in order to effect their
purpose.</p>

<p>When the excitement was at its height, the sacred
call to prayers resounded through the camp, but before
the people fell upon their knees before the One God All
Compassionate and Merciful, with bent body and face
pressed in the dust to acknowledge His Omnipotence,
they had a new indignity to put upon the helpless
stranger. Showing him a wild hog, they bade him kill
and eat it. This he wisely refused. The hog was then
let loose in the belief that it would at once attack the
white man, but instead it rushed at his tormentors.
The sport thus missing its mark, the Moors proceeded
to their devotions, and Park was conveyed to the door of
the tent of Ali’s chief slave, where after much entreaty
he was supplied with a little boiled corn with salt and
water, and then left to pass the night on a mat, exposed
to cold and the dews, and still worse, to the insults and
ribald mirth of the mob which swarmed about him.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>CAPTIVITY IN LUDAMAR.</i></span></h2>

<p>The treatment which Park now experienced in the camp
of Ali was brutal and barbarous beyond description.</p>

<p>In the eyes of the degenerate Arabs of Ludamar
he was an object detestable both to God and man&mdash;a
Christian and a spy. Everything, therefore, that savage
ingenuity could invent to insult and torture him was
heaped upon him with fiendish glee and eagerness.</p>

<p>On the morning after his arrival he was confined in
a small square flat-roofed hut built of corn stalks, which
happily admitted the breeze and excluded the sun. The
hog was tied to the hut as a suitable companion to the
hated Christian.</p>

<p>From morning till night the unhappy prisoner had to
place himself on exhibition, and incessantly demonstrate
the whiteness of his skin, the number of his toes, and
the method of adjusting his dress&mdash;for all which torment
he was repaid with curses. In common with the hog, he
was made the sport of men, women, and children alike.
Not even at night was he left to himself, being continually
disturbed by his guards bent on satisfying themselves
that he was safe in the hut, or by thieves seeking what
they could carry away. To these tortures of mind and
body was added the uncertainty of what might be before
him. A council of elders had considered his case, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
he was variously told that death, the loss of the right
hand, or the putting out of his eyes, was the fate
reserved for him.</p>

<p>To add to the miseries of his condition, he had to
suffer the hardships attendant on the observance of
Rhamadan, the month of fasting, during which the
faithful are not permitted to eat or drink between sunrise
and sunset. This fast from meat and drink, bad
enough at any time in a scorching climate, was rendered
doubly painful to the unhappy traveller by the extreme
scantiness of the supply doled out to him once in the
twenty-four hours at midnight. Then, too, it was the
hottest time of the year, and so scorching at times were
the winds from the desert, that it was impossible to hold
the hand in a draught without pain. Sandstorms, too,
now and again filled the air to the point of suffocation,
while the heavens overhead were as brass, and the sands
under foot as the floor of an oven.</p>

<p>Under these distressing conditions Park’s only <i>rôle</i>
was to comply with every command, and patiently endure
every insult, compatible with appearing as useless as possible
to the tyrants, so that they might not be tempted
to detain him for the value of his services.</p>

<p>Day after day thus passed, each one more miserable
than the preceding, but Park’s iron frame and indomitable
spirit stood it all. Where his savage gaolers failed,
however, the fears and doubts for his future progress
and the ultimate success of his mission threatened to
succeed. The excessive heat and scarcity of water in
the wilderness made escape in the hot season out of
the question, while the hardships and dangers of travel
to be faced in the wet season appeared scarcely less
appalling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>The blackness of the outlook began to cloud even his
sanguine temperament, and the heart sickness of hope
deferred frequently manifested itself in fits of melancholy
and despondency. With the lowering of his mental tone
came also the bodily reaction, and a smart fever was the
result.</p>

<p>Even then he obtained no alleviation of his sufferings.
His distress was a matter of sport to the Arabs, till life
became a burden to him. He trembled at times lest
the peevishness, irritability, and enfeebled power of self-command
accompanying the disease should cause him
to overleap the bounds of prudence, and in the height
of an outburst of passion commit some act of resentment
which would lead to his death&mdash;death, and with his work
unfinished.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions he left his hut and
walked to some shady trees at a short distance from
the camp, where he lay down in the hope of obtaining
a little solitude. He was discovered by Ali’s son and a
band of horsemen, who ordered him to get up and follow
them back to camp. Park begged to be allowed to stay
a few hours. For answer one of the horsemen drew his
pistol, and presenting it at Park’s head, pulled the trigger.
Happily it did not go off. Once more the brute essayed
his weapon with the same result. None of his companions
made the least attempt to stop him. Helpless,
Park could but sit awaiting his doom, what indeed would
have been a happy release from his miseries, only that
as yet the task he had set himself was unaccomplished.
With renewed precautions the pistol was presented a
third time, when the hapless victim, who so far had not
spoken, begged his would-be murderer to desist, promising
at the same time to return with him to the camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>Before Ali his position was no better. With fiendish
malignity the latter played with his prisoner as a cat
does with a mouse, opening and shutting the pan of his
pistol and watching the while the effect on the demeanour
of the white man before him. Getting but small amusement
out of his resolute and indifferent mien, he sent
him off at last with the threat that the next time he
was found wandering outside the camp he would be shot
forthwith.</p>

<p>“One whole month had now elapsed since I was led
into captivity, during which time each returning day
brought me fresh distresses. I watched the lingering
course of the sun with anxiety, and blessed his waning
beams as they shed a yellow lustre along the sandy floor
of my hut, for it was then that my oppressors left me,
and allowed me to pass the sultry night in solitude and
reflection.”</p>

<p>With habit and time Park began to be inured to his
situation. Hunger and thirst were more easy to bear
than at first, and the people getting accustomed to his
presence, were not quite so troublesome. To beguile the
time he made inquiries regarding the route to Timbuktu
and the Haussa countries, and even got some of his tormentors
to teach him the letters of the Arabic alphabet.</p>

<p>About the middle of April Ali proceeded north to bring
back his chief wife Fatima. During the chief’s absence,
though Park was less molested than usual, he was also
less regularly supplied with his scanty rations. For
two successive days he received none at all, and had to
endure the pangs of hunger as best he might. This he
found painful enough at first, but soon discovered that
temporary relief might be had by swallowing copious
and repeated draughts of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>Johnson&mdash;who meanwhile had been brought from
Dina before he could leave for the coast&mdash;and Demba,
not having the spirit of their master to bear them up in
the midst of misfortune, sank into the deepest dejection,
remaining for the most part prostrate on the sands
in a sort of torpid slumber, from which they could
scarcely be roused even when food arrived.</p>

<p>To the languor and debility brought on by semi-starvation
was added on Park’s part the affliction of sleeplessness;
deep convulsive respirations shook him from
head to foot; semi-blindness seized him, and with difficulty
he fought a frequent tendency to faint.</p>

<p>But the cup of his misery was not yet full. The
King of Bambarra, incensed at Ali’s refusal to join him
against Daisy, King of Kaarta, proclaimed war against
him. This threw the country into confusion. The camp
at Benaun was at once broken up, and a retreat further
north commenced. On the first day a halt was made at
a negro town called Farreni.</p>

<p>Again Park’s rations were forgotten. Next day, foreseeing
similar treatment, he proceeded himself to the
head man of the town and begged some food. This was
not only granted, but promised to be continued as long
as he remained in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of May Ali’s camp was reached, and found
to be pitched in the midst of a thick wood. Here Park
was presented to Fatima. This lady was singularly
beautiful, according to the Ludamar Arab idea&mdash;that is
to say, she was remarkably corpulent. “A woman of
even moderate pretensions to appearance must be one
who cannot walk without a slave under each arm to
support her, and a perfect beauty is a load for a camel.”
To attain this pinnacle of perfection, the girls are gorged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
by their mothers with great quantities of kuskus and
camel’s milk, which must be taken no matter what the
appetite may be. “I have seen a poor girl sit crying
with the bowl at her lips for more than an hour, and
her mother watching her all the while with a stick in
her hand, and using it without mercy whenever she
observed that her daughter was not swallowing.”</p>

<p>At first Fatima affected to be shocked at Park’s
appearance, but showed that she had a woman’s heart
by presenting him with a bowl of milk. Later on she
proved to be his best friend.</p>

<p>The heat had now become insufferable. Everything
vegetable was scorched up, and the whole country presented
a dreary expanse of sand dotted over with a few
stunted trees and thorny acacia bushes. Water was
almost unattainable, and night and day the wells were
crowded with cattle lowing and fighting with each other
to get at the troughs. The pangs of thirst rendered
many of them furious and ungovernable, while the
weak, unable to contend for a place, endeavoured to
quench their thirst by licking up the liquid mud from
the gutters&mdash;frequently with fatal consequences.</p>

<p>The suffering due to the scarcity of water extended to
the people, and to no one more than the white captive
among them. If his boy Demba attempted to get a
supply of water, he was usually soundly thrashed for his
presumption. This treatment became so intolerable in
the end that Demba would rather have died than go
near the wells. Park and his attendants were in this
way reduced to begging from the negro slaves, but with
indifferent success. Fatima, however, more than once
relieved their necessities. Nevertheless, time after
time, Park “passed the night in the situation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Tantalus. No sooner had I shut my eyes than fancy
would convey me to the streams and rivers of my native
land; then, as I wandered along the verdant brink, I
surveyed the clear stream with transport, and hastened
to swallow the delightful draught; but, alas! disappointment
awakened me, and I found myself a lonely captive
perishing of thirst amidst the wilds of Africa!”</p>

<p>One night, driven half wild by his tortures, he started
off in search of relief. At every well he found struggling
herdsmen, and from one and all he was driven away with
outrageous abuse. At length at one he found only an
old man and two boys, from whom he was on the point
of receiving what he sought, when, discovering whom
they were about to supply, they dashed the water into
the trough, and told him to drink with the cattle.
Too glad to get water in any way, “I thrust my
head between two of the cows, and drank with great
pleasure, until the water was nearly exhausted, and the
cows began to contend with each other for the last
mouthful.”</p>

<p>Signs that the wet season was approaching began to
show themselves towards the end of May in frequent
changes of the wind, gathering clouds, and distant
lightning. At the same time Park’s fate was approaching
a crisis, and he began to revolve schemes of escape.
His hopes rose high when discovering that Ali was
about to join some rebellious Kaartans in attacking
Daisy, through the intervention of Fatima, he was
permitted to accompany the expedition as far as Jarra.
Once in Kaarta, he hoped that means would be found
to escape from his barbarous captors.</p>

<p>Fatima next conferred a further favour on him by
returning part of his clothes, of which he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
deprived since he fell into Ali’s hands. Following
these came his horse, now reduced, by hard work and
starvation feeding, to skin and bone, but still fit for
work.</p>

<p>On the 26th of May, Park set out with the Moors
towards Jarra, accompanied by Johnson and Demba.
At night they camped at a watering-place in the woods,
but the accommodation being limited, Park was compelled
to sleep in the open in the centre of the huts,
where he could more easily be watched.</p>

<p>In the morning they had to face unprotected all the
violence of a sandstorm, which raged with great fury
the whole day. At times it was impossible to look up.
The cattle, maddened by the driving sand, ran recklessly
hither and thither, threatening to trample the
prisoners to death.</p>

<p>Next day our traveller’s rising hopes received a
serious check. While preparing to depart a messenger
arrived, who, seizing Demba, told him that henceforth
Ali was to be his master, and that he must return at once
to the camp they had left. With him were to go all his
present master’s effects, though “the old fool” Johnson
might go on to Jarra.</p>

<p>Park was completely overwhelmed at the idea of his
faithful boy being sent back to such a life of misery as
would be his lot in the household of Ali. Unable to say
a word to the messenger, he ran straight to the chief
himself, and his indignation for once getting the better
of him, he upbraided him in passionate language for
the new injustice he was about to commit, compared to
which all else was in his eyes as nothing.</p>

<p>To this generous but unwise outburst Ali made no
reply, beyond ordering him, with haughty air and malig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>nant
smile, to mount his horse immediately or be sent
back likewise. Terrible was the struggle in Park’s
inmost soul to refrain from ridding the world of such a
monster, and giving vent to all the suppressed feelings
of the last two months in one passionate outburst.</p>

<p>Happily he had not lost complete control over himself
nor the ability to comprehend his situation, and he
retired from the tent a prey to a hundred harassing
emotions.</p>

<p>“Poor Demba was not less affected than myself. He
had formed a strong attachment towards me, and had
a cheerfulness of disposition which often beguiled the
tedious hours of captivity.” But part they must. “So
having shaken hands with the unfortunate boy, and
blended my tears with his, I saw him led off by three of
Ali’s slaves towards the camp at Bubaker.”</p>

<p>On the 1st of June, Jarra was once more re-entered,
and Park became again the guest of the slatee. Everything
else now became subordinate for the time being
to the one object of procuring the liberty of Demba.
Before this duty even his own escape became of secondary
importance. All his attempts were ineffectual,
however. Ali could not be prevailed upon to sell or
return his new-made slave, though he never ceased to
hold out hopes that Demba might yet be let off for a
consideration.</p>

<p>On the 8th, Ali with his horsemen returned to camp
to celebrate a festival, Park, to his great joy, being left
behind in the house of the slatee. Once more he began
to think of his own safety, seeing that now it was proved
beyond a doubt he could be of no use to Demba.</p>

<p>Meanwhile troubles began to gather rapidly round
Jarra. Ali, after securing the price of his co-opera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>tion,
treacherously left his allies to their fate. Daisy
with his army was rapidly approaching the town, whose
inhabitants could expect no mercy from their enraged
king. Finding themselves left to their own resources,
the latter made such preparation as was in their power to
defend themselves, at the same time sending away their
women and children, with such corn and cattle as they
could take with them. Park prepared to depart along
with these. He saw clearly that if he continued where
he was he would run the risk of being involved in the
general slaughter if Daisy were successful, or if the
reverse, that he would sooner or later fall a victim to the
Moors. And yet to go forward alone seemed terrible
enough&mdash;for Johnson flatly refused to proceed&mdash;without
means of protection or goods to purchase the necessaries
of life, or an interpreter to make himself understood in
the Bambarra language.</p>

<p>The one comparatively easy road was that to the coast,
but “to return to England without accomplishing the
object of my mission was worse than all.”</p>

<p>The old spirit, never quite killed, was beginning to
reassert itself, with the enjoyment of a certain measure
of free will and liberty. Whatever was to be his fate,
he should meet it, he determined, with his face towards
the Niger.</p>

<p>On the night of the 26th, the women worked incessantly,
preparing food and packing articles that were not
absolutely necessary for the flight. Early in the morning
they took the road for Bambarra.</p>

<p>The exodus was affecting in the extreme&mdash;the women
and children weeping, the men sullen and dejected&mdash;all
of them looking back with regret to the spot where they
had passed their lives, and shuddering at the possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
fate before them. Amid many heartrending scenes
Park mounted his horse, and taking a large bag of corn
before him, set forth with the flying multitude.</p>

<p>In this fashion he travelled onward for two days,
accompanied so far by Johnson and the slatee. At
Koiro a halt of two days had to be made to recruit his
half-starved animal&mdash;an unfortunate delay, since it gave
time for Ali’s chief slave and four Moors to arrive in
quest of their white prisoner. This new calamity had
to be met with prompt action if Park was not to face
an indefinite period of miserable captivity. At once he
resolved to escape by flight&mdash;a “measure which I thought
offered the only chance of saving my life and gaining the
object of my mission.”</p>

<p>Johnson was ready to applaud his master’s resolution,
but flatly refused to join him.</p>

<p>The Moors, thinking the white man safe, did not trouble
themselves about him, and he was thus able to prepare
a few articles to take with him. Two suits of clothes
and a pair of boots were all he possessed. He had not
now a single bead or other article of commercial value
to purchase food for himself.</p>

<p>About daybreak the Moors were all asleep. Now was
the time to make good his opportunity. Liberty and
possible success were in the balance with renewed captivity
and possible death. A cold sweat moistened his
forehead as the importance of the step he was about
to take was brought with twofold force to his consciousness.
But to deliberate was to lose the only chance of
escape. He must make one more bold attempt to regain
liberty and reach the Niger. The thought was inspiration.
He picked up his bundle, stepped stealthily over
the sleeping negroes, and reached his horse. Johnson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
was bidden farewell, and once more begged to take particular
care of the papers entrusted to him, and to inform
his friends on the Gambia “that he had left me in good
health, on my way to Bambarra.”</p>

<p>A few years before, Major Houghton had sent an
almost identical message to the same Gambian friends.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>TO THE NIGER.</i></span></h2>

<p>Once outside the village, it behoved Park to be on the
alert, and get as quickly from the vicinity of the Moors
as possible. With his horse reduced to skin and bone
speed was out of the question, while the darkness and
the nature of the country otherwise made progress slow.
And yet how much was staked on every dragging mile&mdash;every
moment might mean freedom or bondage, life
or death to him. Half frantic at the thought of recapture,
he imagined an enemy behind each bush, in every
sound the tramp of pursuing horsemen.</p>

<p>It looked as if his worst apprehensions were about to
be realised when unawares he stumbled upon a Moorish
watering-place. Before he could retreat he was discovered
by the shepherds. Immediately there was a
howl of execration, and he was set upon with stones
and curses, and driven forth as if he had been a
prowling beast of prey.</p>

<p>Thankful to have escaped unhurt, Park, once rid of
the fanatics, began to be more hopeful. He was not to
get away so easily, however. Suddenly a shout rang
behind bidding him halt. He hardly needed to look
to know the nature of the danger that threatened.
Three Moors on horseback were in full pursuit, ferociously
brandishing their weapons, and screaming out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
threats as they bore down on him. Escape was impossible&mdash;his
jaded steed was beyond all urging. With the
dogged indifference of despair he turned and rode back
prepared for the worst. Unmoved he looked at the upraised
muskets of his pursuers&mdash;almost unheeding, so
benumbed were his faculties, he heard that they were
sent to bring him back to Ali. In reality, however,
the Moors were robbers, and their object merely
plunder.</p>

<p>On reaching a wood the wretches ordered their prisoner
to untie his bundle. Great was their disgust
to find nothing worth taking but a cloak. But to
Park his cloak was the sole protection from the rains
by day and the mosquitoes by night, and in vain he
followed the robbers, trying to move their compassion,
and earnestly begging them to return the garment.
For sole reply, one of the band, annoyed at his persistence,
presented a musket at him, while another struck
his horse a brutal blow over the head. There was no
resisting these hints, and once more possessed by the
keen desire for life and liberty, Park parleyed no longer,
but turned and rode off.</p>

<p>The moment he was out of sight he struck into
the woods to avoid similar encounters. As he passed
on, the sense of security growing ever stronger with
the passing night, his sanguine temperament gradually
resumed its sway. He felt as one recovered from a
dangerous illness&mdash;he breathed freer, his limbs were
as if released from cramping fetters, while the Niger
magnet drew him on irresistibly as ever. Life became
more desirable, earth and heaven more beautiful,
and even the desert lost half its terrors. Beggary and
the miseries of the rainy season grew less terrible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
face with the growth of the hope that the guerdon of
success was yet to be won.</p>

<p>But man cannot live on hope alone. However fair
it might paint the vision of the future, it could not
stifle the present demands of nature. Only too painfully
Park awoke to the fact that starvation stared
him in the face. He was destitute, and could not buy;
unarmed, and therefore could not take; hunted, and
therefore dared not beg. His every step was beset with
innumerable dangers. His one chance lay in reaching a
Bambarra village, where he would be among the negroes,
and safe at least from the Moors.</p>

<p>To the pangs of hunger was speedily added the
yet more painful agony of thirst. The sun overhead
beat down upon him from heavens of lurid brilliancy.
The scorching white sands, blinding to look upon, reflected
back the heat as from the mouth of a furnace.</p>

<p>From the tree tops not a trace of human habitation
was to be seen. Alone patches of thick scrub and
hillocks of barren sand met the eye. In pushing on
lay the only hope of escaping death. With his old
undaunted spirit Park elected to push on&mdash;to struggle
while his legs would carry him.</p>

<p>Towards four in the afternoon he came suddenly upon
the dreaded yet welcome sight of a herd of goats. They
were at once an indication of a great danger, and of
possible food and water. His joy was great when after
a cautious examination he discovered that the herd was
tended only by two boys. With difficulty he approached
them.</p>

<p>“Water! water!” he gasped. For answer the goatherds
showed their empty water-skins, telling him at
the same time that no water was to be found in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
woods. Sick at heart and well-nigh exhausted, Park
turned away to resume his weary tramp and almost
hopeless quest.</p>

<p>Night was approaching, and already his limbs were
failing him. His thirst had become intolerable, and his
mouth was parched and inflamed. Sudden attacks of
dimness at times came over his eyes, and more than
once he almost fainted. Each moment it became increasingly
clear that if he did not reach water before
the dawn of another day he must inevitably perish. To
relieve the pains in his throat and mouth he chewed
the leaves of different shrubs, but only added to his
agony.</p>

<p>In the evening he reached a ridge, and climbing a
tree, gazed eagerly over the land&mdash;only a barren wilderness
deserted by God and man spread out before him.
“The same dismal uniformity of shrub and sand everywhere
presented itself, and the horizon was as level and
uninterrupted as that of the sea.”</p>

<p>The sun sank, and with it went the fugitive’s last
hope. He was too weak to walk, and his horse, as
much exhausted as himself, could not carry him. Even
in his own extremity he had yet a kind thought for his
faithful dumb companion, and that it might the better
shift for itself he took off its bridle. Even as he did so
a horrid sensation of sickness and giddiness seized him,
and he fell on the sand, believing that his last hour had
come.</p>

<p>In one swift flash of thought he saw the end of his
weary struggle, and with it all his hopes of doing something
worthy of remembrance. Then the shadow of
death gathered over him, and he sank back unconscious.</p>

<p>But all was not yet over&mdash;for Park life had still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
somewhat in store of work and gladness. With the
lowering of the temperature and the rising of the cool
night breeze he awoke from his death-like swoon, and,
gathering himself together, he resolved to make one
more attempt to keep death at bay. With his old
strength of will, though weak in limb, he staggered
forward into the darkness of night, which seemed only
too like the prospect before him. A few minutes more
and a flash of lightning illumined the surrounding
landscape. To him that flash was a promise of rain,
and gave birth to a new hope that his agonies from
thirst would soon be at an end. Soon flash followed
flash, more and more dazzling, nearer and nearer.
With a painful eagerness the exhausted wanderer
watched the coming storm. He had no further occasion
to struggle forward. He had but to sit still and wait.
But what hopes and fears the while! Would it rain or
not? Would the storm break on him, or career past on
either side? Another hour and the answer came. On
his ear fell the welcome sound of trees bending before
the blast. His fevered face felt the first cool puffs of
wind. A black column, dimly discerned in the darkness,
and laden with moisture, as he thought, reared
itself before him. It blotted out earth and sky, and
tore onward borne on the wings of the wind. He
rose to meet and welcome it. His parched mouth was
opened to taste the heaven-sent rain. When, oh, misery!
he found himself enveloped in a suffocating sandstorm.
Stricken with unutterable disappointment, he sank to the
ground behind a sheltering bush.</p>

<p>For above an hour the storm swept over him in
choking whirlwinds. When it ceased, Park with undaunted
spirit resumed his way in the darkness, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
with ever intensifying thirst, ever lessening strength&mdash;perilously
near his last struggle.</p>

<p>Again the lightning flashed across the sky. He
hardly dared to hope, yet, nevertheless, he turned
his burning face and stretched his shaking hands towards
the advancing storm-clouds, that he might feel
the first refreshing drops. This time there was no
mistake, and tearing off his clothes, he spread them
out to collect the heaven-sent rain, while all naked to
the storm, amid the blinding glare of tropic lightning
and the frightful crash of thunder, he sucked in the
moisture by every pore of his body.</p>

<p>But he was only relieved of one series of pangs to be
reminded that others lay behind&mdash;the miseries of starvation
had still to be faced. There could be no rest, no
sleep for him, till food as well as water was obtained.
Accordingly he resumed his way, directing his footsteps
by the compass, which the frequent flashes of lightning
enabled him to consult. Soon these welcome gleams
ceased, and then he had to stumble along as best he
might. About two in the morning a light appeared.
Thinking it might proceed from a negro town, he groped
about in the darkness unsuccessfully trying to ascertain
whether it was so or not, from corn-stacks or other signs
of cultivation. Other lights now became visible, and he
began to fear he had fallen upon a Moorish encampment.</p>

<p>Soon his worst doubts became certainties, and rather
than fall into the hands of his late persecutors he
elected to face death in the wilderness. As stealthily as
possible, however, he tried to discover the water. In
doing so a woman got a glimpse of him, and her scream
brought up two men, who passed quite close to where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
had crouched to hide himself. Clearly this was no place
for him, and once more he plunged into the sheltering
woods. He had not proceeded far when the loud croaking
of frogs told him where to slake his thirst.</p>

<p>This narrow escape inspired Park to renewed exertions.
At daylight he detected a pillar of smoke at a
distance of twelve miles, and towards it he painfully
plodded. After five hours of extreme toil the village
from which the smoke arose was reached, and from a
husbandman he heard that it was a Fulah village
belonging to Ali. This was unpleasant news.</p>

<p>To enter might possibly mean return to captivity, yet
possibly, too, he might be allowed to go unmolested.
Meanwhile the immediate certainty was that he was
dying of hunger, and that his position could hardly be
made worse. Determined, therefore, to take his chance
of the result, he rode into the village. On his applying
at the head man’s house, the door was slammed in his
face, and his appeals for food were unheeded. Dejectedly
he turned his horse’s head, seeing nothing before him but
death in the woods. As he was leaving the village he
remarked some mean dwellings. Might he not make
another trial. Hospitality he remembered did not
always prefer the dwellings of the rich.</p>

<p>Prompted by the thought he advanced towards an
old woman spinning cotton in front of her hut. By
signs he indicated that he wanted food, leaving his
haggard face and sunken eyes to tell the rest. Nor did
he appeal in vain. The hut was opened to him, and such
food as its owner could give was placed in his hands.
The first pangs of hunger allayed, Park’s next thought
was for the four-footed sharer of his toils and agonies,
and for it too a speedy supply of corn was forthcoming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile a dubious crowd gathered outside, and
solemnly debated what they should do with the stranger
who had thus appeared among them. Opinion was
divided, however; and Park, seeing the danger of his
position, thought it better to leave, however footsore
and weary he might be. On seeing their unbidden
guest prepare to depart, the villagers came to the conclusion
that their wisest course was to do nothing.</p>

<p>Once clear of the town, and the boys and girls who
followed him for some time, Park, who had not slept for
more than two days and nights, sought the shade of a
sheltering tree, and laid himself down to rest. Early
in the afternoon he was awakened by two Fulahs, but
without entering into conversation with them he continued
his journey towards Bambarra and the Niger.
It was not till midnight that finding a pool of rain
water he again halted. Sleep, however, of which he
stood terribly in need, was out of the question. The
mosquitoes assailed him in maddening myriads, while
the howling of wild beasts added to the terrors of his
surroundings.</p>

<p>After a miserable night, the day was hailed with relief
and delight. At midday another Fulah watering-place
was reached, and here Park was hospitably received by
a shepherd, who gave him boiled corn and dates for
himself, and corn for his horse. Resuming his journey
with fast returning hope and vigour, the resolute traveller
pushed on, determined to journey all night.</p>

<p>At eight in the evening he heard wayfarers approaching,
and had to hide himself in a thicket, and there hold
his horse’s nose to prevent him neighing. At midnight
the joyful sound of frogs apprised him of the neighbourhood
of water. Having quenched his thirst, he sought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
out an open space in the wood and lay down to sleep,
happily unmolested till near morning, when some wild
beasts compelled him to look after the safety of himself
and his animal. Resuming his tramp, Park crossed the
frontiers of Bambarra, and felt for the first time for
many weary weeks in comparative safety and free from
the horrid Moorish nightmare which had so long haunted
him. At Wawra he was hospitably received by the
chief of the village, and at last worn out with excessive
fatigue and starvation, but rejoicing in the sweet new
sense of security, was able to lay himself down and
enjoy the luxury of a deep sound sleep.</p>

<p>To Park everything now seemed hopeful and encouraging.
He was destitute and alone&mdash;a beggar in
the heart of Africa; but now that he had safely escaped
from the deserts of the north, and from the clutches of
their fanatical and degraded Moorish inhabitants, his
sanguine temperament made small account of his personal
troubles. It was sufficient to know himself in a
land of plenty, with villages at every mile, and among
a people of kindly nature.</p>

<p>His hopes were not belied. Everywhere his reception
was hospitable. The villagers gave of their food
and shelter; the wayfarers their company, assistance,
guidance, and protection. At most places he was not
recognised as being a white man, but from his strange
and destitute appearance was assumed to be a pilgrim
from Mecca, and treated by the Faithful with the consideration
such an one deserved. And thus the days
passed on, ever bringing him nearer the goal of his
hopes, ever adding to his assurance that the great
prize for which men and nations had struggled for
three centuries was to be his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>On the night of the 20th July, Park took up his
quarters at a small village. Here he was told that he
would see the Niger&mdash;or, as the natives called it, the
Joliba or Great Waters&mdash;on the morrow.</p>

<p>The thought was intoxication, and between it and the
myriad mosquitoes that preyed upon his unprotected
body, sleep was out of the question. Before daylight he
was up and doing, and had saddled his horse long ere
the gates of the village were opened.</p>

<p>At length he got away. With eager eyes he looked
towards the south&mdash;towards what for many terrible
months had been his Kiblah&mdash;his Mecca. At last he
was about to be rewarded for all the tortures of body
and mind he had so heroically endured, so resolutely
faced.</p>

<p>The road was crowded with natives hurrying towards
the capital. Four large villages were passed, and then
in the distance loomed up the smoke of Sego&mdash;Sego
on the banks of the Niger! A little further and the
joyful cry, “See the water!” announced to Park that
the Niger was in sight. Ay, truly, there it was, sweeping
along in a majestic stream towards the east, and
glittering in the bright rays of the morning sun.</p>

<p>One long and ardent look, one sigh of supreme relief,
and the pilgrim of geography hastened to the brink,
and after drinking of the water, lifted up a fervent
prayer to the Great Ruler of all things for having thus
crowned his endeavours with success.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>DOWN THE NIGER TO SILLA.</i></span></h2>

<p>Thus was the River Niger for the first time reached by
an European, and its eastward course determined. Park
had left England inclined if anything to believe that it
flowed west; but during his journey that opinion had
gradually been undermined, and now with his own eyes
he saw that its course was indeed towards the rising sun.
There was no further question as to where it took its
rise: its termination was now the great mystery which
remained to be cleared up.</p>

<p>Sego, the capital of Bambarra, at which the white
traveller had arrived, consisted of four distinct towns,
two on the north bank of the Niger, and two on the
south. Each was independently surrounded by high
mud walls. Unlike the ordinary negro village, the
houses were square with flat roofs, and built of mud.
Some of them were two stories in height, and a few
were whitewashed.</p>

<p>Besides these evidences of Arab influence, there were
mosques in every quarter; and the whole town, with
its thirty or forty thousand inhabitants, presented an
air of civilisation and magnificence which Park was far
from expecting. The river swarmed with large canoes,
constantly crossing and recrossing; the streets were
crowded with a busy population; and the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
surrounding country was in the highest state of cultivation.</p>

<p>Park speedily discovered that Mansong, king of Bambarra,
lived on the south side of the river, and he
prepared at once to cross and present himself at court.
The crowded state of the ferry prevented him carrying
out his intention immediately, as he had to wait his
turn. In the interval the people gathered round him in
silent wonder, full of speculation as to what could have
brought the white man so far from the sea. With no
small apprehension the weary traveller noticed among
the crowd a numerous sprinkling of Moors. In each of
the race he saw a malignant enemy who would stop at
nothing to do him an ill turn, so indelible was the impression
produced on him during his residence with Ali
at Benaun.</p>

<p>An opportunity for crossing at last offered itself.
Just as he was about to take advantage of it, a messenger
arrived from the king to intimate that he could not
possibly see his intending visitor until he knew what had
brought him into the country. Meanwhile he was on
no account to presume to cross the river without Mansong’s
permission, and must lodge for the night at a
distant village which the messenger pointed out.</p>

<p>This reception was eminently discouraging. But
Park was inured to disappointments, and happy in so
far as he had at least seen and drunk of the waters of the
Niger, he could bear with more equanimity such further
reverses as might be in store for him. It required all
his philosophy to sustain him, however, when on reaching
the village he was refused admittance at every door.
Every one looked upon him with astonishment and fear
as a being of unknown species, whose power of physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
or spiritual mischief was incalculable, and had better
not be tried by closer contact than could be helped.</p>

<p>Thus shunned and boycotted as a human pariah, and
not knowing where to go to seek shelter, Park sat down
under a tree, which at least protected him from the overpowering
glare of the sun. Hour after hour passed,
and still no one offered him food or lodging. The day
drew to a close. The wind rose, and clouds gathered
threateningly in the sky. Everything portended a night
of storm.</p>

<p>The sun fell, and still he sat unheeded. Darkness
began to gather round him with tropical swiftness, and
he lost all hope of moving the compassion of the natives
by his forlorn and helpless condition. To escape death
from lions and hyenas, he prepared to ensconce himself
among the branches of the tree. Before doing so he
proceeded to take off the bridle and saddle from his
horse, that it might have greater freedom and ease in
grazing. While thus engaged a woman returning from
her work in the fields passed him. It required no words
to tell her the stranger’s plight. His dress and face
spoke eloquently of weariness, destitution, hunger, and
dejection. The negress stopped to ask his story. A few
words told all that was necessary to move her woman’s
heart, and without further questioning she picked up
his saddle and bridle and bade him follow her to her
hut. There she lighted a lamp and spread out a mat
for her guest.</p>

<p>In a short time a fine fish was broiling on the embers
of the fire, while the various members of the family
sat looking at the stranger in gaping wonder. A few
minutes more and Park had satisfied his hunger and
disposed himself to sleep. The women resumed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
work of spinning wool, and while they worked they sang.
To sweet and plaintive melody they wedded kindliest
words, and their guest was the burden of their song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">“The winds roared and the rains fell,</div>
<div class="i0">The poor white man sat under our tree;</div>
<div class="i0">He has no mother to bring him milk,</div>
<div class="i0">No wife to grind his corn.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And oft recurring came the chorus&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">“Let us pity the white man,</div>
<div class="i0">No mother has he.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Such, literally translated, were the words of the improvised
song, and listening to them, sleep was driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
from Park’s eyes, as he turned and tossed a prey to the
liveliest emotions of gratitude. Far into the night the
women worked, and spinning ever sang&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">“Let us pity the white man;</div>
<div class="i0">No mother has he;”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>while outside the tornado spent its violence in blinding
flashes and deafening peals of thunder, in raging blasts
of wind and drenching showers of rain.</p>

<p>In the morning, as a token of gratitude, Park presented
his kindly hostess with two of the four brass
buttons remaining on his waistcoat, the sole articles he
possessed having any value in native eyes.</p>

<p>During the day numerous rumours of the inimical
machinations of the Moors came to Park’s ears, but
nothing definite concerning Mansong’s decision as to
his fate.</p>

<p>On the following morning, the 22nd, a messenger
arrived to inquire what present the white man had
brought to the king.</p>

<p>On the 23rd another messenger arrived, bearing the
king’s refusal to give Park an audience. It was accompanied
by a present of five thousand cowries&mdash;the currency
of the Sudan Basin&mdash;to enable him to purchase
provisions, while indicating that his presence at Sego
was undesirable, though he was at liberty to proceed
farther down the Niger, or to return to the Gambia, as
he pleased.</p>

<p>In Mansong’s refusal to see him, Park could only see
the “blind and inveterate malice of the Moorish inhabitants,”
though he could not but admit that the manner
of his appearance among the people of Sego, and the to
them incredible explanation of the object of his journey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
warranted suspicion. To see the Joliba! Absurd!
Were there then no rivers in the white man’s own
country that he should face such hardships and dangers
to see ours? There must be something else behind.
Send him away, but being destitute, let us supply his
wants, so that the stigma of his death lie not at our
doors. Such, it may be presumed, was Mansong’s mode
of reasoning, and such naturally the conclusion he
arrived at.</p>

<p>Park was now called upon to make up his mind as
to his future course. Would he go on or turn back?
Surely he might return with all honour now that he
had reached the Niger itself. Destitute as he was, what
could he do? And yet it was hard to have to retrace
his steps with such a glorious work before him. No, onward
at least some distance he must go, to see and learn
something more of the river’s course and termination,
perchance even to reach Timbuktu.</p>

<p>Park did not reach this conclusion without some misgiving,
for he heard vague reports that the farther east
he proceeded the more numerous became the Arab tribes,
and that Timbuktu itself was in the hands of “that
savage and merciless people.” Whatever his horror of
the Moors might be, however, he could not let his plans
be stopped by “such vague and uncertain information,
and determined to proceed.”</p>

<p class="caption">BAMBARRA WOMEN POUNDING CORN.</p></div>

<p>Thus dauntlessly did our hero gather his rags about
him, and with his bag of cowries proceed on the 24th on
the exploration of the Niger River. On the first day he
passed through a highly cultivated country, resembling
the park scenery of England. The people were everywhere
collecting the fruit of the Shea tree, from which
the vegetable butter so named is produced. Park found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the Shea butter whiter and firmer, and to his palate of
a richer flavour, than the best butter he ever tasted made
from cow’s milk&mdash;a strange statement certainly, since
to the palates of degenerate travellers and traders of
the present day its taste is abominable. Even among
the natives it is only used by the very poorest for
cooking purposes, being considered infinitely inferior to
palm oil.</p>

<p>In the evening Park reached Sansanding, a town of
some two thousand inhabitants, largely resorted to by
Moors from Biru engaged in exchanging salt and the
commodities of the north for cotton cloth and gold dust.
To slip as quietly into the town as possible, Park passed
along the riverside, and by the natives was everywhere
taken to be a Moor. At length a real Moor discovered
the mistake, and by his exclamations brought a crowd
of his countrymen about the stranger.</p>

<p>Amid the shouting and gesticulating mob Park contrived
to reach the house of Counti Mamadi, the Duté of
the place. The Moors, with their customary arrogance
and assumption of superiority, pushed aside the negroes,
and began to ask questions concerning Park’s religion.
Finding that he understood Arabic, they brought two
men whom they called Jews, and who in dress and
appearance resembled the Arabs, and were said to conform
so far to Islam as to recite in public prayers
from the Koran. The Moors insisted that the stranger
should do the same as the Jews. He tried to put off
the subject by declaring that he could not speak Arabic,
when a sherif from Tawat started up and swore by the
Prophet that if the Christian refused to go to the
mosque, and there acknowledge the One God and His
Prophet, he would have him carried thither.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>Willing hands were ready to carry out this determination,
but happily the Duté interfered, and declared the
white stranger should not be ill treated while under his
protection. This stopped immediate violence, but did
not end the persecution. The crowd continued to swell,
and grew ever more ungovernable. The clamour and
excitement intensified every minute. Every coign of
vantage was covered with multitudes eager to see the
newcomer. That every one might be gratified he was
compelled to ascend a high seat near the door of the
mosque, where he had to remain till sunset, when he was
permitted to descend and seek refuge in a neat little
hut having a court in front of it. Even here, however,
he found neither peace nor quiet. The Moors, though
in the country only as traders, seemed to be allowed to
do very much as they liked. They climbed over the court
walls and invaded Park’s privacy, desirous, as they said,
of seeing him at his evening devotions, and also eating
eggs. The latter operation Park was by no means loth
to accomplish, though the intruders were disappointed
on discovering that he only ate them cooked.</p>

<p>It was not until after midnight that the Arabs left
the traveller alone. His host then asked him for a
charm in writing, which was at once supplied in the
form of the Lord’s Prayer.</p>

<p>From Sansanding, Park proceeded to Sibila, and
thence to Nyara, where he stayed on the 27th to wash
his clothes and rest his horse.</p>

<p>At Nyami, a town inhabited chiefly by Fulahs, the
head man refused to see Park, and sent his son to guide
him to Madibu.</p>

<p>Between the two villages the travellers had to proceed
with very great caution, as the district was noto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>rious
for its dangers from wild beasts. A giraffe was
seen, and shortly afterwards, in crossing a broad open
plain with scattered bushes, the guide who was ahead
suddenly espied traces of a lion in the path, and called
loudly to Park to ride off. His horse, however, was too
exhausted for flight, and he continued to ride slowly on.
He was just beginning to think that it had been a false
alarm, when a cry from the guide made him look up in
renewed trepidation. There was the lion lying near a
bush, with his head couched between his fore-paws. To
fly was impossible. Instinctively Park drew his feet
from his stirrups, to be ready to slip off and leave the
horse to bear the first onslaught if the lion should spring.
With eyes riveted on the enemy he slowly advanced,
expecting each moment that the lion would be upon him.
The brute did not move, however, having probably just
dined, and being in a peaceful mood in consequence.
All the same Park was so held by a sort of wild fascination
that he found it impossible to remove his gaze
until he was a considerable distance out of danger.</p>

<p>To avoid any more such perils, Park took a circuitous
route through some swampy ground, and at sunset
safely entered Madibu. This village was perched on the
banks of the Niger, of whose majestic stream it commanded
a splendid view for many miles&mdash;a view further
varied by several small green islands occupied by Fulah
herds.</p>

<p>Here life was rendered almost unendurable by mosquitoes,
which rose in such myriads from the swamps
and creeks as to harass even the most thick-skinned and
torpid of the natives. The nights were one continuous
maddening torture, Park’s rags affording him no protection
from their attacks. Unable to sleep, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
to keep ceaselessly walking backwards and forwards,
fanning himself with his hat to drive off his pertinacious
tormentors. Nevertheless, by morning, his legs, arms,
neck, and face were covered with blisters. No wonder,
under such circumstances, that he grew feverish and
uneasy, and threatened to become seriously ill. Perceiving
this, the Duté of Madibu hurried him off, lest
he should die on his hands.</p>

<p>Park’s horse was as little able to carry him as he to
walk. They had not struggled on many miles before
the poor animal slipped and fell, and do what Park
might, was not to be got up again. In vain he waited in
the hope that after a rest the horse might come round.
In the end there was nothing for it but to take off
saddle and bridle, place a quantity of grass before him,
and then leave him to his fate. At the sight of the poor
brute lying panting on the ground his owner could not
suppress a foreboding that he likewise before long would
lie down and perish of hunger and fatigue. Oppressed
with melancholy, many fears, and only too numerous
physical ills, he staggered on till noon, when he reached
the small fishing village of Kea.</p>

<p>The head man was sitting at the gate as he entered,
and to him he told his story of destitution and sickness.
But he spoke to one of surly countenance and crabbed
heart, and his sole reply to the half dead stranger was
to bid him begone from his door.</p>

<p>The guide remonstrated, and Park entreated, but all
to no purpose. The Duté was inflexible.</p>

<p>At this juncture a fishing canoe arrived on its way
to Silla, whereupon, to put an end to further parley, the
Duté desired the owner to convey the stranger to that
place. This, after some hesitation, the fisherman con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>sented
to do. Before setting forth Park asked his guide
to see to his horse on the way back, and take care of
him if he was still alive.</p>

<p>In the evening he reached Silla. Hoping that some
one would take compassion on him, he seated himself
beneath a tree, but though surrounded by wondering
hundreds, no one offered him hospitality. Rain beginning
to come on, the Duté was at length prevailed upon
by Park’s entreaties to let him sleep in one of his huts.
The hut was damp, and a sharp attack of fever was the
result. Let the traveller describe his situation at this
juncture in his own words.</p>

<p>“Worn down by sickness, exhausted with hunger and
fatigue, half naked, and without any article of value
by which I might get provisions, clothes, or lodging, I
began to reflect seriously on my situation.</p>

<p>“I was now convinced by painful experience that the
obstacles to my further progress were insurmountable.
The tropical rains were already set in with all their
violence, the rice grounds and swamps were everywhere
overflowed, and in a few days more travelling of every
kind, unless by water, would be completely obstructed.
The cowries which remained of the King of Bambarra’s
present were not sufficient to enable me to hire a canoe
for any great distance, and I had but little hopes of
subsisting by charity in a country where the Moors
have such influence.</p>

<p>“But above all, I perceived that I was advancing more
and more within the power of those merciless fanatics,
and from my reception both at Sego and Sansanding
I was apprehensive that in attempting to reach even
Jenné (unless under the protection of some man of
consequence amongst them, which I had no means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
obtaining), I should sacrifice my life to no purpose, for
my discoveries would perish with me.</p>

<p>“With this conviction on my mind, I hope my readers
will acknowledge that I did right in going no farther.
I had made every effort to execute my mission in its
fullest extent which prudence could justify. Had there
been the most distant prospect of a successful termination,
neither the unavoidable hardships of the journey,
nor the danger of a second captivity, should have forced
me to desist. This, however, necessity compelled me to
do; and whatever may be the opinion of my general
readers on this point, it affords me inexpressible satisfaction
that my honourable employers have been pleased
since my return to express their full approbation of my
conduct.”</p>

<p>And who will not cordially coincide in their verdict?
Never had a mission been more determinedly carried
out, nor such inexhaustible patience and endurance
shown in the face of every conceivable hardship, indignity,
and danger&mdash;all of which were counted by
the sufferer as naught compared with the inexpressible
pleasure of achieving something of the task he had been
despatched to accomplish.</p>

<p>When he thus made up his mind to return to the
coast, Park had followed the Niger a distance of over
eighty miles from Sego, finding that it still maintained
its easterly course. In addition, he gathered from various
traders the fact that it continued in the same direction
for four days’ journey more, when it expanded into a
lake of considerable size, named Dibbie, or “The Dark
Lake.”</p>

<p>From Dibbie (Debo) the Niger was said to divide
into two branches, enclosing a large tract of land called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
Jinbala, and uniting again after a north-easterly course
near Kabra, the “port” of Timbuktu. From Jenné to
the latter place the distance by land was twelve days’
journey.</p>

<p>From Kabra, Park does not seem certain&mdash;at least he
does not make it clear&mdash;what course the Niger took,
though he correctly enough states that at the distance
of eleven days’ journey it passes to the south of Haussa
(probably what is now known as Birni-n-Kebbi, a large
town in Gandu, one of the Haussa States). Beyond
this nothing further was known. It seems evident,
however, that Park confounded the course of the Niger
with that of its great eastern tributary the Benué, as
had most of the geographers before him; and so was led
astray from seeking for its natural termination in the
Atlantic.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>THE RETURN THROUGH BAMBARRA.</i></span></h2>

<p>Park’s resolution to return to the coast was taken on
the 29th July 1796. His hope of accomplishing this
purpose in safety seemed almost as desperate as the task
of going forward. Before him lay a journey on foot of
eleven hundred miles in a straight line, to which must
be added an additional five hundred for deviations and
the windings of the road. He had thus before him
nineteen hundred miles on foot through a barbarous
country, where the stranger was considered fair prey,
and the laws afforded him no protection from violence.
He was without the wherewithal to buy food, and had
only rags to shield him from the violence of the weather
and the maddening onslaughts of mosquitoes. In addition
he had to face all the horrors of the tropic winter,
tornadoes of wind, rain, and thunder overhead, swamps
and mire under foot, and flooded streams barring the
way at every turn. The hardships were sufficient to
have killed any man of less indomitable spirit and
weaker frame. Even Park would probably have succumbed,
but that he could not die while his discoveries
remained uncommunicated to his employers and the
public. Till then his work was only half done. With
his death it would be wholly undone&mdash;all his toil and
suffering in vain. To reach the coast was therefore now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
a point of as much importance as formerly it had been
to see the Niger.</p>

<p>His mind once made up, Park acted with promptitude
and resolution.</p>

<p>He arrived at Silla on the 29th July. The night
sufficed to determine his course, and morning saw the
commencement of his return journey. It behoved him
indeed to waste no time. A few days more and the
country would be impassable by land on account of the
flooded rivers. Already it was so on the southern side
of the Niger&mdash;a fact Park much regretted, as he had
hoped to return by that way.</p>

<p>Crossing to Murzan by one canoe, he was there
enabled to hire another to Kea. Here he was permitted
to sleep in the hut of one of the head man’s slaves, who,
seeing him sick and destitute of clothes, compassionately
covered him with a large cloth.</p>

<p>Next day, in proceeding to Madibu with the head
man’s brother, he had an opportunity of seeing a peculiar
instance of the native respect for private property
under some circumstances. A large pile of earthenware
jars were lying on the bank of the river. They had been
found there two years before, and as no one had ever
claimed them, they were believed to belong to some
supernatural power. People passing invariably threw a
handful of grass upon them, which Park thinks was to
protect them from the rain, but more likely was meant
as a propitiatory gift to the spirit&mdash;the practice being
common over all Central Africa.</p>

<p>Some time after passing the jars the fresh footprints of
a lion were discovered. The travellers had accordingly to
proceed with very great caution. Nearing a thick wood
where the dangerous brute was supposed to have its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
lair, the guide insisted that Park should lead the way.
Unarmed as he was, the latter naturally objected, and
urged further that he did not know the road. High
words followed, which ended in the desertion of the
negro.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it now but to proceed alone,
lion or no lion. With no small trepidation Park passed
between the wood and the river, expecting every moment
to be attacked. Happily he was left to pursue his way
unmolested, and reached Madibu late in the afternoon.
Here he was joined by the deserter. While in the act
of remonstrating with him for his recent conduct, a horse
commenced to neigh in a neighbouring hut. With a
smile the head man asked Park if he knew who was
speaking to him, and showed him the horse, which
turned out to be no other than the traveller’s own, very
much improved by its rest.</p>

<p>Next day Park re-entered Nyami, and there was
practically imprisoned by three days’ continuous rain,
the after results of which he had the most serious
reasons to fear. Nor were his apprehensions belied.
When he left Nyami the country was deluged, the fields
knee deep in water for miles together, and the pathways
undiscoverable. Where not actually submerged the land
was one great quagmire, in which Park’s horse stuck
more than once, and had almost to be abandoned.</p>

<p>Next day the rain fell in torrents, detaining him
again, and making travelling almost impossible. With
difficulty he plunged and floundered a few miles through
a swamp breast deep in water, and managed at length to
reach a small Fulah village.</p>

<p>With tracks obliterated and the country thus flooded,
it now became imperative that he should not travel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
alone. No guide, however, was to be found to show
him the way and assist him at difficult places.</p>

<p>For some distance he accompanied a Moor and his
wife who were proceeding to Sego with salt. They rode
on bullocks, and proved to be as helpless as himself.
At one place one of the bullocks suddenly fell into a
hole in a morass, and sent both salt and wife into the
water.</p>

<p>At sunset he reached Sibity, where an inhospitable
reception awaited him. A damp old hut was all he
could get in which to pass the night. Each moment he
expected to see the rotten clay roof fall in&mdash;a common
occurrence at the commencement of the rainy season.
On all sides he heard the sound of similar catastrophes,
and in the morning counted the wreck of fourteen
dwellings.</p>

<p>Throughout the following day it continued to rain
violently, making travelling out of the question.</p>

<p>On the 11th August, the head man compelled Park
to move on. A new danger, it appeared, had fallen on
his trouble-strewn way. It had got abroad that he was
a spy, and not in favour with the king&mdash;a report sufficient
to close each head man’s door against him, and
extinguish every hospitable feeling in the naturally
kindly heart of the negro. He was now an object not
merely to be treated with passive indifference, but
actively shunned as a possible danger to whomsoever
should have dealings with him.</p>

<p>With no small foreboding he re-entered Sansanding.
Counti Mamadi, who formerly had protected him from
the Moors, would now have nothing to do with him,
and desired him to depart early in the morning. That
the head man in thus acting did violence to his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
natural kindliness was sufficiently shown by his coming
privately to Park during the night and warning him
of the dangerous situation he was in. Especially he
advised him to avoid going near Sego.</p>

<p>This unpleasantly altered state of matters was further
illustrated when arriving next day at Kabba, he was
met outside the town by a party of negroes, who seized
his horse’s bridle, and in spite of his remonstrances, conducted
him round the walls, and ordered him to continue
his way lest worse should befall him. A few miles further
on he reached a small village, but found no better reception.
On his attempting to enter, the head man seized
a stick and threatened to knock him down if he moved
another step. There was nothing for it but to proceed
to another village, where happily some women were
moved to compassion by his destitute appearance, and
contrived to get him a night’s lodging.</p>

<p>On the 13th, he reached a small village close to Sego,
where he endeavoured in vain to procure some provisions.
He heard, moreover, that there were orders out
to apprehend him, and it was clear that it would be
highly dangerous for him to remain an hour where he
was. He accordingly pushed on through high grassy
and swampy ground till noon, when he stopped to consider
what route he should now pursue. All seemed
alike bad, but everything considered, he elected to proceed
westward along the Niger, and ascertain if possible
how far it was navigable in that direction.</p>

<p>For the next three days his journey was unattended
with any worse hardship than having to live upon raw
corn, lodging for the night having been obtained without
much difficulty. It was different, however, on the evening
of the 15th, when, on his arrival at the small village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
of Song, he was refused admittance within the gates.
The numerous footprints which he had seen while on the
march had made it abundantly clear that the country
was infested with lions. The prospect of spending the
night in the open without means of defence was therefore
anything but pleasant; but it had to be faced.
Hungry and weary himself, he could still think of his
horse, and he set about gathering grass for him. With
nightfall, no one having offered him food or shelter,
he lay down under a tree close to the gate, but dared
not allow himself to sleep. With leaden shoon the
minutes passed. Every sound was a note of danger,
and in a state of painful alertness the outcast wanderer
peered into the blackness of night, ever expecting to see
a creeping form, or the glitter of two fierce eyes.</p>

<p>At length, some time before midnight, a hollow roar
suddenly resounded through the wood, apparently coming
from no great distance. In the darkness he could
see nothing, strain as he might. To sit thus defenceless
awaiting his doom, yet not knowing when or whence
it would come, was intolerable, and driven frantic at last
by the horror of his situation, he rushed to the gate,
and madly tugged at it with all the energy of one who
struggles for dear life. In vain, his utmost efforts were
as little able to move it as were his urgent appeals to
touch the hearts of the natives.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the lion was all unseen prowling round
the village, ever lessening its circle and drawing nearer
its prey. At last a rustle among the grass warned Park
of its whereabouts and dangerous proximity. A moment
more and he would be in its fatal clutches. His sole
chance now lay in reaching a neighbouring tree. With a
rush he gained and climbed it, and then feeling compara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>tively
safe among the sheltering branches, he prepared
to pass the night there. A little later, however, the
head man opened the gate and invited the stranger to
come within the walls, as he was now satisfied that he
was not a Moor, none of whom ever waited any time
outside a village without cursing it and all it contained.</p>

<p>From Song the country began to rise into hills, and
the summits of high mountains could be seen ahead.
Even here, however, travelling continued to be a matter
of toil and danger, all the hollows through which the
road ran being transformed into nasty swamps. At
one point Park and his horse fell headlong into an unseen
pit, and were almost drowned before, covered with
mud, they succeeded in emerging. One of the worst
features of such occurrences was the danger he incurred
of losing his notes, or finding them rendered useless&mdash;a
misfortune which would have gone far to bring the
results of his toil to naught.</p>

<p>After the above mishap, Park rode through Yamina,
a half-ruined town covering as much space as Sansanding.
Many Moors were sitting about, and everybody watched
him passing with astonishment.</p>

<p>Next day the road quitted the Niger plain and skirted
the side of a hill. From this higher elevation the whole
country had the aspect of an extensive lake.</p>

<p>His next journey brought him to the Frina, a deep
and rapid tributary of the Niger. He was preparing
to swim across when he was stopped by a native, who
warned him that both he and his horse would be devoured
by crocodiles. On his hastily withdrawing from the
water, the man, who had never seen a European before,
and now saw one minus his clothes, put his hand to
his mouth, as is the fashion among most negroes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
expressing astonishment, and uttered a smothered, awe-stricken
exclamation. He did not run away, however,
and by his assistance the proper ferry was found, and
Park safely landed on the opposite bank.</p>

<p>In the evening the traveller arrived at Taffara, where
he met with a most inhospitable reception. This was
partly due to the fact that a new head man was being
elected. No one would take him in, and he was compelled
to sit under the palaver tree supperless, and
exposed to all the rude violence of a tornado. At midnight
the negro who had shown Park the way&mdash;himself
a stranger to the village&mdash;shared his supper with him.</p>

<p>On the following march Park was glad to appease
his hunger with the husks of corn. At a village further
on he found the head man of the place in a bad temper
over the death of a slave boy, whose burial he was superintending.
The process was sufficiently summary. A
hole having been dug in the field, the corpse of the boy
was dragged out by a leg and an arm and thrown with
savage indifference into the grave. As there seemed to
be no chance of procuring food, Park rode on to a place
called Kulikorro, where his reception was more kindly.
Here he found he could relieve his wants by writing
saphias or charms for the simple natives. The charm
being written on a board, the ink was then washed off
and swallowed, so as to secure the full virtue of the
writing. The practice is taken from the more ignorant
of the Arabs, who think that by drinking the ink used
in writing the name of Allah or prayers from the Koran
they will derive a spiritual or material good.</p>

<p>Thanks to the demand for charms of this nature, Park
was enabled to enjoy the first good meal and night’s
rest he had known for many days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>On the second day from Kulikorro he was directed on
the wrong road, whereby he was brought late in the afternoon
to a deep creek, which there was nothing for it but
to swim, spite of the danger of being seized by crocodiles.
This he did, holding the bridle of his horse in his teeth,
and carrying his precious notes in the crown of his hat.
An obstacle of this kind, however, was but a small
matter to Park, who between rain and dew was now
rarely dry, while the mud with which he was only too
frequently bespattered made a swim both pleasant and
necessary.</p>

<p>On this day’s march the Niger was remarked to be
flowing between rocky banks with great rapidity and
noise, so that a European boat would have had some
difficulty in crossing the stream.</p>

<p>Bammaku was reached in the evening of the 23rd
August, and proved to be a disappointment in the matter
of size, though its inhabitants were remarkably well off
on account of its being a resting-place for the Arab salt
merchants. The Moors here were unusually civil to the
traveller, and sent him some rice and milk.</p>

<p>The information Park obtained at Bammaku as to his
further route was anything but encouraging. The road
was declared to be impassable. Moreover, the path
crossed the Joliba at a point half a day’s journey west
of Bammaku, where no canoes were to be had large
enough to carry his horse. With no money to support
him, it was useless to think of remaining at Bammaku
for some months. He therefore made up his mind to
go on, and if his horse could not be got across the river,
to abandon it and swim across alone.</p>

<p class="caption">BAMMAKU.</p></div>

<p>In the morning, however, he heard from his landlord
of another and more northerly road, by way of a place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
called Sibidulu, where he might be enabled to continue
his journey through Manding. An itinerant musician,
going in the same direction, agreed to act as guide.</p>

<p>At first Park was conducted up a rocky glen, but had
not gone many miles when his companion discovered that
he had taken the wrong road, the right one being on the
other side of the hill. Not seeing it to be his duty to
repair his blunder as far as possible, the guide threw
his drum over his shoulder and continued his way over
the rocks, whither Park could not follow him on horseback,
but had to return to the plain and find his way
himself.</p>

<p>Happily he succeeded in striking a horse track, which
proved to be the right road; and soon he had reached
the summit of the hill, where an extensive landscape
spread out before him. The plain at his feet was half
submerged under the Niger waters, which at one place
spread out like a lake, at another were gathered into a
curving river, while far to the south-east, in the hazy
sheen of distance, the summits of the Kong Mountains
could be dimly descried.</p>

<p>Towards sunset the road descended into a delightful
valley, leading to a romantically situated village named
Kuma. Here Park for once met with a pleasant welcome.
Corn and milk in abundance were placed ready
for himself, and abundance of grass for his horse. A
fire even was kindled in the hut set apart for him, while
outside the natives crowded round him in naïve wonderment,
asking him a thousand questions.</p>

<p>Fain would Park have lingered in this village to rest
and recruit, but an eager longing possessed him to push
on, lest the loss of a day should prove fatal to his further
progress. Two shepherds proceeding in the same direc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>tion
as himself agreed to accompany him. In some
respects the road proved to be more difficult and dangerous
than anything he had previously passed. At
places the ascent was so sharp, and the declivities so
great, that a single false step would have caused his
horse to be dashed to pieces at the bottom of the
precipices.</p>

<p>Finding that they were able to travel faster than
their white companion, the shepherds after a time
pushed on by themselves. Shortly afterwards, shouts
and screams of distress apprised Park that something
had gone wrong ahead. Riding slowly towards the
place whence the alarm had seemed to proceed, and
seeing no one, he began to call aloud, but without
receiving any answer. By-and-by, however, he discovered
one of the shepherds lying among the long
grass near the road. At first his conclusion was that
the man was dead, but on getting nearer him he found
that he was still alive, and was told in a whisper that
the other had been seized by a party of armed men.</p>

<p>On looking round, Park was alarmed to discover that
he was himself in imminent danger. A party of six or
seven men armed with muskets were watching him.
Escape being impossible, he considered it his best course
to ride towards them. As he approached he assumed
an air of unconcern, and pretending to take them for
elephant hunters, he asked if they had shot anything.
For answer one of the party ordered him to dismount;
then, as if thinking better of it, signed to him to go on.
Nothing loth, Park rode forward, glad to be relieved
from the fear of further ill-treatment.</p>

<p>His relief, however, was of short duration. A loud
hullo brought him suddenly to a standstill. Look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>ing
round, he saw the robbers&mdash;for such they were&mdash;running
towards him. Park stopped to await their
coming. He was then told that they had been sent by
the King of Fulahdu to bring him and all that belonged
to him to his capital. Park, to avoid ill-treatment, unhesitatingly
agreed to follow them, and in silence the
party travelled across country for some time. A dark
wood was at last reached. “This place will do,” said one
of the party, and almost simultaneously the unfortunate
traveller was set upon, and his hat torn from his head.
To lose his hat was like losing his life, for it contained
all that made life dear to him for the time being. He
betrayed no sign of trouble, however, but simply declared
that he would go no further unless his hat was returned.</p>

<p>For answer one of the band drew a knife, and cut
the last metal button from Park’s waistcoat. The
others then proceeded to search his pockets, which
he permitted them to do without resistance. Finding
little to satisfy their rapacity, they stripped him
naked. His very boots, though so sadly dilapidated as
to need a part of his bridle-rein to keep the soles on, were
minutely examined. Yet even at this lowest depth of
ignominy his paramount thought was his work. He
could endure the loss of the last shred of clothing, but
to be deprived of his notes and his compass was insupportable.
Seeing the latter lying on the ground, he
begged to have it returned to him. In a passion one of
the robbers picked up his musket and cocked it, declaring
that he would shoot him dead on the spot.</p>

<p>Humanity, however, was not quite suppressed in the
hearts of these scoundrels, for after a moment’s deliberation
they returned him a shirt and a pair of trousers.
As they were about to depart the one who had taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
his hat jeeringly tossed it back to him. Never with
more eagerness and delight did despairing mother gather
to her bosom a long lost child, than did Park to his the
battered remnant of a hat which contained his precious
store of notes. With them there was still something worth
struggling for, hopeless as his case might seem.</p>

<p>Never surely was man more tried. At every step he
had met with new calamities, new obstacles, miseries,
and dangers. Man and nature were alike in conspiracy
against him. And now he had to add to his previous
destitution semi-nakedness, and the loss of his horse.
With hundreds of miles still before him, how could he
hope to run the gauntlet of the fresh difficulties and
dangers he would undoubtedly have to face? Yet even
as he conjured up before his mind the perils ahead from
wild beasts and evilly disposed men, from swamp and
flood, from wind and rain, he began to take comfort as
he recalled to mind his numerous past escapes, which
were to him as proofs positive of a protecting Providence
which never yet had failed him in his hour of need.</p>

<p>As his thoughts took a more hopeful turn, and his
sanguine temperament and rooted faith in a God who
overruled all things reasserted their influence, Park’s
gaze fell upon a tuft of moss. Irresistibly his mind was
diverted from the horrors of his position to the beauty
of the lowly plant before him. As he examined with
admiration its delicate conformation, the thought occurred
to him, “Can that Being who planted, watered,
and brought to perfection in this obscure part of the
world a thing which appears of so small importance,
look with unconcern upon the situation and sufferings of
creatures formed after His own image? Surely not!”</p>

<p>The next moment the old spirit came back to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Not yet would he succumb. While there was life in
him he would struggle, and while he could struggle
there was hope. Starting up, he pushed forward once
more, assured in his mind that relief was at hand. Nor
was he disappointed. Near a small village he found the
two shepherds, in whose company he once more proceeded,
till at sunset they entered Sibidulu, his destination
for the time being.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>REST AT KAMALIA.</i></span></h2>

<p>Park had now entered the country of Manding. Sibidulu,
from its position in a small valley surrounded by
high rocky hills impassable to horsemen, had had the
singular good fortune to escape being plundered during
the numerous wars from time to time waging around
it. To this happy immunity may possibly be ascribed
the reception accorded to Park in his hour of need. As
he entered the town the people gathered round and
accompanied him in a pitying crowd to the head man
of the village in order to hear his story.</p>

<p>While he related the circumstances of his ill treatment
the native official listened with becoming gravity, and
smoked his pipe the while. The narrative finished, the
latter drew up the sleeve of his cloak with an indignant
air, and laying aside his pipe, told the white man
to sit down. “You shall have everything returned to
you. I have sworn it!”</p>

<p>Turning to an attendant, he ordered him to bring the
stranger a drink of water, and then proceed over the
hills at dawn of day to inform the chief of Bammaku
that the King of Bambarra’s stranger had been robbed
by the people of the King of Fulahdu.</p>

<p>The head man did not confine himself to words or
to water. A hut was given to Park, and food to eat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
though the crowd which gathered round to commiserate
the white man’s misfortunes could with comfort have
been dispensed with.</p>

<p>The generosity of his reception was all the more admirable
that at the time the people were suffering from
semi-famine. Under these circumstances, after having
waited two days in vain for the return of his horse and
clothes, Park, afraid of becoming a burden to his kind
host, asked permission to proceed to the next village.
The head man showed no anxiety to hasten his guest’s
departure, but in the end told him to go to Wonda,
and remain there till news was received of his missing
possessions.</p>

<p>Accordingly on the 30th, he proceeded to the place indicated,
a small town with a mosque, where his reception
by the Mansa or chief was as hospitable as at Sibidulu.</p>

<p>The attacks of fever which had finally compelled Park
to turn back at Silla now began to return with greater
violence and frequency, and little wonder either that it
should be so. His solitary shirt, worn to the thinness of
muslin, afforded him neither protection from the sun by
day nor from the dews and mosquitoes by night. As,
also, it had become unpleasantly dirty, at Wonda he set
about washing it, and had to sit naked in the shade till
it dried. The result was a violent attack of fever which
prostrated him for nine days.</p>

<p>All the while he had to do his best to conceal his
illness, lest his host should find him too great a nuisance,
and order him to move on. To this end he tried, like
sick or wounded animals, to hide himself away out of
sight, usually spending the whole day lying in the corn-field,
thus undoubtedly aggravating his malady.</p>

<p>At this time the scarcity of food was so great that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
women brought their children to the head man to sell
for forty days’ provisions for themselves and the rest
of their families.</p>

<p>At last messengers arrived from Sibidulu, bringing
Park’s horse and clothes. To his profound dismay and
disappointment the compass&mdash;which next to his notes was
his most valuable possession&mdash;was broken and useless.
The loss was irreparable.</p>

<p>The horse proving to be a mere skeleton, he was
handed over as a present to his kind landlord.</p>

<p>Though still ill with fever, and hardly able to totter
along, the traveller now resumed his weary way.</p>

<p>On the two succeeding days starvation added to his
weakness. On the third a negro trader gave him some
food, and afterwards conducted him to his house at
Kinyeto. Here, as if he had not yet sufficiently run
the gamut of human suffering, he must needs endure
the agonies of a sprained ankle, which swelled and inflamed
so that he could not set his foot to the ground.
The kindly trader, however, made him welcome to stay
until quite recovered, but Park did not trespass on his
hospitality longer than was absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>In three days he was sufficiently well to be able to
limp along with the assistance of a staff, and in this
fashion he contrived to hobble to Jerijang, whose chief&mdash;there
being no king in Manding&mdash;was considered the
most powerful in the country.</p>

<p>Dosita was the next village reached, and here rain
without and delirium within compelled him to remain
one day. Recovering slightly, he set out for Mansia.
The road led over a high rocky hill, and almost proved
too much for the exhausted wayfarer, who had to lie
down at intervals to recover. Though only a very few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
miles distant, it was late in the afternoon before he
reached the town. Here he was given a little corn to
eat, and a hut to sleep in. Evidently, however, the head
man thought Park richer than he looked, and during
the night made two attempts to enter the hut, being
each time frustrated by the traveller’s vigilance. In the
morning the latter thought it better to take French
leave of such a host, and accordingly at daybreak set
forth for Kamalia, a small town situated at the bottom
of some rocky hills. This place he reached in the course
of the afternoon.</p>

<p>At Kamalia, one Karfa Taura, brother of the hospitable
negro trader of Kinyeto, extended a like welcome
to the wayworn white man. By this time, so yellow
was the latter’s skin from his repeated fevers, and so
poverty-stricken his appearance, that the trader was only
convinced of his nationality when on showing him a
white man’s book in his possession, he found the traveller
could read it. This was a Book of Common Prayer,
of which Park obtained possession with no small surprise
and delight.</p>

<p>Not too soon had some means of spiritual consolation
come to him, for here he learned that the country before
him&mdash;the Jallonka Wilderness, with its eight rapid rivers&mdash;was
absolutely impassable for many months to come.
Even then, when caravans found it difficult and dangerous,
what would it be to a defenceless and destitute
single man? With the knowledge that further advance
at the present was hopeless, came the realisation of the
fact that to utter exhaustion of outward resources was
now to be added the complete loss of all inward force
and strength. Exposure, hunger, toil, and fever had at
last triumphed over Park’s iron constitution, and laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
him low. He might still will not to die, still hope that
he would yet reach the coast, still keep up his determined
and sanguine spirit; but meanwhile, what could
he do when his physical powers had thus failed him?</p>

<p>But even in that moment, when he found himself
overshadowed by despair and death, and at the extreme
limit of all his earthly resources, he was once again to
prove that a “Protecting Providence” watched over
him. In his supreme need a kind host had been provided
in the person of Karfa Taura to save him from
death by fever and starvation, and not only to lodge and
feed him, but at the proper time to conduct him to the
Gambia, whither he was going with a slave caravan.</p>

<p>“Thus was I delivered by the friendly care of this
benevolent negro from a situation truly deplorable.
Distress and famine pressed hard upon me. I had
before me the gloomy wilds of Jallonkadu, where the
traveller sees no habitation for five successive days. I
had almost marked out the place where I was doomed, as
I thought, to perish, when this friendly negro stretched
out his hospitable hand to my relief.”</p>

<p>But neither food nor suitable shelter could stay the
course of the fever. Each succeeding day saw Park
weaker, each night more delirious, till at length he could
not even crawl out of the hut. Six weary weeks he passed
hovering between life and death&mdash;alone sustained by his
intense religious beliefs and his eager hope of reaching
the coast before he died. Little wonder surely that at
times he spent “the lingering hours in a very gloomy
and solitary manner,” while the rains dashed down
remorselessly on the hut wherein he lay in the damp
stifling atmosphere and semi-darkness.</p>

<p>At length with the passing season the rains became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
less frequent, and the ground in consequence more
dry. With improved conditions came improved health
and stronger hope of life. At times the convalescent
managed to crawl to his door to sniff the fresher and
more wholesome air, to bathe in the bright light, and
look upon the blue heavens. It was as if he had
emerged from an open grave.</p>

<p>Soon from the door of his hut he could totter with
his mat to the grateful shade of a tamarind tree, and
there enjoy the refreshing smell of the growing corn,
and the varied prospect of hill and valley, field and
grove around him. At other times naïve converse with
the simple natives, and half hours with his book of
prayers, made glad the passing day.</p>

<p>Through it all Karfa Taura was ever the generous
host and faithful friend, though many there were who
vainly tried to turn him against his unknown guest.</p>

<p>Occasionally parties of slaves were conveyed through
Kamalia. Once one of the unfortunate captives asked
Park for food. The latter represented that he was himself
a stranger and destitute. “I gave you food when
you were hungry,” was the reply; “have you forgot the
man who brought you milk at Karankalla? But,” added
he with a sigh, “the irons were not then on my legs.”
Much touched, Park recalled the incident, and instantly
begged some ground-nuts for him from Karfa.</p>

<p>With returning health of both body and mind, Park
employed himself while wearily awaiting the completion
of the slave caravan in a variety of inquiries regarding
articles of commerce, trade routes, &amp;c. Among other
subjects he was much interested in the slave trade. He
learned the various ways in which slaves were obtained&mdash;how
the natives kidnapped from neighbouring villages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
and petty states, or warred with each other to keep up
the traffic&mdash;how parents found a source of temporary
relief in times of famine by selling their children, and
kings a source of revenue by disposing of their subjects
or those convicted of crimes, while people unable to
meet their engagements in the ordinary way paid their
debts by becoming the slaves of the creditors. Of the
bloodshed and ruin resulting from the unholy traffic
he had himself seen much, and now heard more, while
remaining blind to Europe’s share in encouraging this
“great open sore” of Africa, that its merchants and
planters might be enriched thereby. As for the unhappy
victims of European commerce, they had a deeply rooted
belief that they were to be devoured by white cannibals,
and that the country across the sea was an enchanted
land quite different from their own. Their usual question
to Park was, “Have you really got such ground as
this to set your feet upon?”</p>

<p>These ideas naturally caused the slaves to regard their
fate at the coast with terror and horror, and to seek every
opportunity of escaping.</p>

<p>Each day Park could see his future companions to the
Gambia marched out, secured from flight by having the
right leg of one attached by fetters to the left leg of
another, with the additional precaution that every four
men were fastened together by the necks with a strong
rope. Some who were not amenable to this form of
discipline had a cylinder of wood notched at each end
fastened between the legs with iron bolts. At night
additional fetters were put on the hands, and occasionally
the prisoners were made further secure by having a light
iron chain passed round their necks. Thus loaded with
irons on neck, hand, and foot they were placed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
batches and left to find sleep as best they could, guarded
by Karfa Taura’s domestic slaves.</p>

<p>One pleasant sight there was of which Park never
wearied&mdash;the Mohammedan schoolmaster of Kamalia,
and his school of seventeen boys and girls. To him “it
was not so much a matter of wonder as a matter of
regret to observe that while the superstition of Mohammed
has in this manner scattered a few faint dreams of
learning among these poor people, the precious light of
Christianity is excluded. I could not but lament,” he
continues, “that although the coast of Africa had now
been known and frequented for more than two hundred
years, yet the negroes still remain entire strangers to
the doctrines of our holy religion.... Perhaps a short
and easy introduction to Christianity, such as is found
in some of the catechisms for children, elegantly printed
in Arabic, and distributed on different parts of the coast,
might have a wonderful effect.... These reflections
I have thus ventured to submit to my readers on this
important subject, on perceiving the encouragement
which was thus given to learning (such as it is) in many
parts of Africa. I have observed that the pupils of
Kamalia were most of them children of Pagans; their
parents therefore could have had no predilection for the
doctrines of Mohammed. Their aim was their children’s
improvement.” So much indeed was education prized
that the usual course was valued at the price of a prime
slave.</p>

<p>By the beginning of the year 1797, everything was
ready for departure, but on various trivial pretexts the
leave-taking was put off from day to day till the approach
of Rhamadan, when it was determined to wait till it was
over before commencing their journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>During the whole of the month of fast “the negroes
behaved themselves with the greatest meekness and
humility, forming a striking contrast to the savage
intolerance and brutal bigotry which at this period
characterise the Moors.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>THE SLAVE ROUTE.</i></span></h2>

<p>In the second week of April the Mohammedans of
Kamalia were on the alert for the expected appearance
of the new moon, which would terminate their month of
fasting. On the evening of this joyful event it seemed
for a time as if they were to be disappointed, and that
yet another day would have to be added to their Rhamadan.
Clouds veiled the sky. Only temporarily, however.
The obscuring mists broke, and the delicate curved
beauty of the new moon gleamed upon the upturned
faces, and carried joy to every Mussulman heart. Shrill
screams from the women and shouts from the men,
hand clapping, drum beating, and musket firing gave
voice to the general delight.</p>

<p>Orders were at once given by Karfa to prepare for
the march, and on consultation the 19th of April was
chosen for the day of departure. This was good news
for Park, who, sick with hope long deferred, and
“wearied with a constant state of alarm and anxiety,
had developed a painful longing for the manifold blessings
of civilisation.” All the slatees had done their best
to set Karfa against the white stranger, and the latter
constantly feared that their evil machinations might
prevail, and that he would be cast forth helpless and
destitute among the dangerous wilds of Africa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>At last the wished-for day of departure arrived. The
slatees assembled with their slaves before their leader
Karfa’s door. The bundles were finally roped, and the
loads assigned to the men and women who were to carry
them. When mustered, the caravan numbered thirty-five
slaves, and thirty-eight free people and domestic
slaves, a schoolmaster with eight pupils, and six singing
men to lighten with song and antic the toils of the route,
while at the same time making the presence of the caravan
more welcome to the natives, and its reception more
hospitable at their hands.</p>

<p>Amid much hand-shaking and various manifestations
of fear, regret, and grief, the signal to start was given,
and the caravan set out on its journey. At a rising
some distance out of town a halt was called. All were
ordered to seat themselves, the departing band of travellers
with their faces towards the west, the townspeople
who had so far accompanied them with theirs towards
Kamalia and the east. The schoolmaster and two of
the principal slatees, placing themselves between, raised
a long and solemn prayer that their journey might
be successful and safe under the protection of Allah.
Afterwards the caravan was encircled three times, that
a charm might be woven round the party, and their
safety thus further ensured. The ceremony concluded,
all sprang to their feet, and without further leave-taking
the start was made towards the ocean.</p>

<p>At first the movements of many of the slaves were
eloquent of the fetters they had worn for years. Their
attempts at walking were marked by spasmodic contractions
of the legs, and very soon two of them had to
be released from the rope to allow them to go slower, so
painful were their efforts to step out freely and briskly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p><div class="center">

<p class="caption">BAOBAB TREE.</p></div>

<p>In two marches Worumbang, the western frontier
village of Manding, was reached without mishap. The
party was now on the verge of the dreaded Jallonka
Wilderness. Provisions had to be gathered for the
passage of this trying region, and every one rested to
prepare for the forced marches and hardships ahead.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 21st the outskirts of the
wilderness were entered. On reaching the woods a halt
was called, and a prayer offered up that Allah and his
prophet might preserve them from robbers, keep them
from hunger, and sustain them under fatigue. This
ceremony over, it behoved every man to push forward
with all his strength and will if Kinytakuro, the proposed
destination of that day’s march, was to be reached
before dark. Every one, bond and free alike, knew the
dangers before him, and ran rather than walked.</p>

<p>Soon the Niger basin was left, and the Kokoro, a
tributary of the Senegal, was reached. At this time it
was a mere rivulet, but there was ample evidence to
show that during the rainy season it had risen twenty
feet.</p>

<p>No halt was made throughout the day&mdash;nothing was
heard but the order to push on. Well indeed was it
for those who had the strength to do so. Some there
were who could not. A woman and a girl began to lag
behind. Threats and curses from time to time incited
them to spasmodic efforts at exertion, but soon these
failed in their effect, and fell on unheeding ears. The
lash was next brought into play, and for a time gave the
needed stimulus. Then it too failed. Savage hands
grasped the unhappy victims of European commerce
and dragged them forward, while others behind plied
the whip with unabating ferocity. The limits of nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
were reached at last, and both sank to the ground, not
to be moved by any form of fiendish cruelty. Furious
and disappointed, their master had at length to give
in, and make up his mind to return home for the time
being.</p>

<p>About sunset the town of Kinytakuro was reached,
and the anxieties of the first day’s march were over.
The entry to the town was made with much ceremony
and circumstance. The musicians led the way singing
the praises of the villagers, their hospitality, and their
friendship to the Mandingoes. After them followed
some of the free men; then came the slaves, fastened
in fours by a rope round the neck, with an armed
man between each set. Behind the raw slaves came the
domestic slaves, while the rear was brought up by the
free women, the wives of the slatees, the scholars, &amp;c.
In this way the caravan marched to the palaver house,
where the people gathered round to hear their story;
after which lodgings and food were provided for the
entire party.</p>

<p>At daybreak on the 23rd, the wilderness proper was
entered. At ten o’clock the river Wonda, flowing to
the Senegal, was crossed, and then strict commands were
given that close order should be maintained, and every
man travel in his proper station.</p>

<p>The guides and the young men led the way, the
women and slaves occupied the centre, while the free
men brought up the rear. The country through which
they passed unmolested, though with hurried footsteps,
was charming in the extreme, with its variety of hill
and dale, of glade and wood, and meandering streams,
to which partridges, guinea fowl, and deer gave an air
of animation. On this day Park got his arms and neck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
painfully blistered by the burning sun, from which his
scanty dress afforded him no protection.</p>

<p>At sunset a romantic stream called Comcissang was
reached, and here the party halted for the night,
thoroughly fatigued with their day’s exertions, though
no one was heard to complain. Large fires were kindled
for cooking purposes, as well as to light up the camp
and drive away wild beasts. Supper over, the slaves
were put in irons to prevent their escaping, and then
all disposed themselves to sleep; but between ants
within the camp and wild beasts howling without the
night’s rest was sadly broken.</p>

<p>At daybreak morning prayers were said, after which
a little gruel was drunk by the free men, the irons
being thereafter once more taken off the slaves, and
the march resumed.</p>

<p>The route now led over a wild and rocky country,
where Park, with nothing better than sandals to protect
his feet, got sadly bruised and cut. Fears began to
oppress him that he would not be able to keep up with
the caravan, and that he would be left behind to perish.
The sight of others more exhausted than himself was,
however, in some sort a relief from his apprehension.
Neali, one of Karfa’s female slaves, especially showed
signs of giving in. She began to lag behind, complaining
of pains in her legs, and her load had to be taken from
her and given to another. About midday, while halting
at a rivulet, an enormous swarm of bees, which had
been disturbed by one of the men, set upon the caravan,
and sent it flying in all directions. When the panic
had subsided, it was discovered that Neali had been
left behind. Before going back in search of her it
was necessary to set fire to the grass to the east of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
hive in order to clear away the bees with the smoke.
The plan was effectual, and on returning to the rivulet,
Neali was found half dead in the water, whither she
had crept in the hope of escaping the onslaught of the
bees. The stratagem had been of no avail, however,
and the poor creature was almost stung to death.</p>

<p>It was the last drop in her cup of misery. Nothing
else could touch her. Entreaties and threats were alike
useless. Further forward she doggedly refused to go.
Once more the efficacy of the whip was tried. Down
came the brutal lash. The girl writhed in every muscle,
but she neither screamed nor attempted to rise. Again
the lash swung round her shrinking body, but with no
more effect. Not until it had descended a third and a
fourth time did her resolution give way. Then stung to
superhuman effort by the fearful torture, she started up
and staggered forward for some hours, till wild with
agony she made a mad attempt to run away, but fell
fainting among the grass. Her master’s only remedy
was the lash, and that he applied with renewed savagery.
In vain&mdash;Neali was beyond its cruel compulsion. As a
last resource the donkey which carried the dry provisions
was brought, and the half dead slave placed on his back.
But the girl’s only wish was to die, nay, even now she
seemed as one already dead.</p>

<p>Unable even if she had been willing to retain her seat,
and the donkey at the same time emphatically objecting
to his new load, that means of carriage had to be given
up. The day’s journey, however, was nearly over, and
Neali being a valuable slave, the slatees could not bring
themselves to abandon her. Accordingly, they made a
rude litter of bamboo canes, on which she was carried
until the camping ground for the night was reached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>It now became evident that Neali was not the only
slave for whom the journey was proving too much. The
hard march with heavy loads under a broiling sun, without
food, and with no better stimulant than blows and
curses&mdash;with nothing to look forward to at night but
additional chains, and in the future a horrible fate at
the hands of white men across the seas&mdash;all this was
beginning to have its natural effect. Sullen despair was
in every feature&mdash;every gesture. Death, suicide, seemed
preferable to such a chain of horrors.</p>

<p>The slatees were not slow to mark these ominous signs.
At once fetters were applied&mdash;the more desperate of the
slaves having even their hands chained; and thus bound
they were left to rest as best they might.</p>

<p>Throughout the night Neali lay torpid and almost
motionless, and morning found her with limbs so stiff
and swollen that she could not stand, much less walk.
The donkey was again brought into requisition, and to
keep her on his back the girl’s hands were tied round
his neck, and her feet under his belly. Spite of these
precautions, however, before long the donkey threw her,
and bound as she was, she was nearly trampled to death
before she could be released.</p>

<p>Meanwhile precious time was being wasted in a
wilderness where every minute was of the utmost importance.
To carry the girl in the fashion of the previous
evening was out of the question, and the patience
of every one was exhausted. “Cut her throat! cut her
throat!” was the cry now raised by the slave dealers.
Strange to say, Park did not seem to have anything to
urge against this brutal suggestion&mdash;for Neali indeed the
most merciful ending of her troubles&mdash;though being unwilling
to see it put in force, he walked on ahead. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
few minutes later one of Karfa’s men came up to him
carrying Neali’s scanty cotton garment, which to Park
was eloquent of the poor girl’s fate. He could not bring
himself to make inquiries then, but later on he learned
that Neali had not had the good fortune to have her
tortures ended at once by the knife. She was deserted,
and a day of exposure, naked to the remorseless sun,
without food or drink, had to drag slowly on before
darkness drew a veil over the last horrible scene, in
which she met death under the fangs of the wild beasts
of the Jallonka Wilderness.</p>

<p>The fate of the slave girl had a wonderfully stimulating
effect on the rest of the caravan; but the schoolmaster,
in doubts as to how Allah would regard the
incident, fasted the whole day. In deep silence the
slaves travelled onward at a steady pace, each apprehensive
that his too might be the fate of Neali. No one
was more apprehensive than Park himself. Only by
the most determined effort of will did he keep himself
from succumbing on the march. Everything that could
obstruct him in the least&mdash;even his spear&mdash;was thrown
away, but still he could just barely struggle on. “The
poor slaves, amidst their own infinitely greater sufferings,
would commiserate mine, and frequently of their
own accord bring water to quench my thirst, and at
night collect branches and leaves to prepare me a bed
in the wilderness.”</p>

<p>On the morning of the 26th, two of the schoolmaster’s
pupils complained of pains in their legs, and one of the
slaves walked lame, the soles of his feet being much
blistered and inflamed. But there could be no halting
for such trivial causes, and the caravan pushed onward
with hot haste, eager to escape as soon as possible the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
hardships and dangers of the desert. In the middle of
the day a rocky hill was reached, the crossing of which
greatly aggravated the sores on the travellers’ feet. In
the afternoon evidences of a raiding party of horsemen
were seen, and to hide their track the caravan had to
disperse and travel wide apart for some distance.</p>

<p>Another day of toil ended the desert march. On
the 27th, the village of Susita, in the district of Kullo,
was entered. The rest of the road was comparatively
safe. Next day the Bafing or Black River, the principal
branch of the Senegal, was crossed by a bamboo
bridge of singular construction. Trees tied end to end
were made to support a roadway of bamboos&mdash;the centre
of the bridge floating on the water, the ends resting on
the banks. On the rising of the water during the rains
this primitive bridge is carried away each year.</p>

<p>Though the caravan had now got into a well-populated
district, their troubles were hardly over. They
were refused admittance at village after village, and to
complete their discomfiture, news came that two hundred
Jallonkas had gathered to plunder them. This necessitated
an alteration in their route, and a forced night
march. After midnight a town was reached, but as a
free man and three slaves were found to be missing,
a halt was called, and while the caravan remained
concealed in a cotton field, a search party returned to
look for the runaways. In the morning the town was
entered, and the day was passed in resting from their
fatigues. Here, to the joy of all, the absentees turned
up safely. One of the slaves had hurt his foot, and
they had thus lagged behind and lost the caravan.
The free man, foreseeing the danger of an outbreak,
insisted on putting the slaves in irons. This they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
inclined to resist, but a threat to stab them all had its
due effect.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of May the caravan reached the schoolmaster’s
native village, Malacotta, where in consequence
a hearty welcome awaited them. Three days were spent
here recruiting the party. During that time Park
learned the particulars of a remarkable story of Moslem
zeal and Pagan chivalry and generosity, well worthy of
being retold.</p>

<p>“The King of Futa Torra, inflamed with a zeal for
propagating his religion, had sent an embassy to Damel,
King of the Jaloffs.</p>

<p>“The ambassador was accompanied by two of the
principal Mohammedans of the country, who each carried
a knife fixed on the top of a long pole. ‘With this
knife,’ said the ambassador, ‘Abdul Kader will condescend
to shave the head of Damel, if Damel will
embrace the Mohammedan religion; and with this other
knife Abdul Kader will cut the throat of Damel if Damel
refuse to embrace it. Take your choice.’</p>

<p>“Damel replied that he had no choice to make. He
neither chose to have his head shaved nor his throat
cut; and with this answer the ambassador was civilly
dismissed. War was accordingly declared, and the
country of Damel invaded. The fortune of war, however,
went against the earthly instrument of Allah,
and his army was not only dispersed with great loss,
but he himself taken prisoner. In this humiliating
position Abdul Kader was brought in irons and thrown
on the ground before Damel. Instead of setting his
foot on the neck of his royal prisoner and stabbing him
with his spear, as is the custom in such cases, Damel
addressed him as follows&mdash;‘Abdul Kader, answer me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
this question. If the chance of war had placed me in
your situation, and you in mine, how would you have
treated me?’</p>

<p>“‘I would have thrust my spear into your heart,’
answered the brave though fanatical prince; ‘and I
know that a similar fate awaits me.’</p>

<p>“‘Not so,’ said Damel. ‘My spear is indeed red with
the blood of your subjects killed in battle, and I could
now give it a deeper stain by dipping it in your own;
but this would not build up my towns, nor bring to life
the thousands who fell in the woods. I will not therefore
kill you in cold blood, but I will retain you as my
slave until I perceive that your presence in your own
kingdom will be no longer dangerous to your neighbours,
and then I will consider of the proper way of
disposing of you.’ A decision which has been made the
subject of the songs of the musicians, and a matter of
applausive comment by all the tribes.</p>

<p>“Abdul Kader was accordingly retained, and worked
as a slave for three months; at the end of which period
Damel listened to the solicitations of the inhabitants of
Futa Torra, and restored to them their king.”</p>

<p>Of the truth of this story there seems to be no doubt.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>BACK TO THE GAMBIA AND HOME.</i></span></h2>

<p>At Malacotta, Park could look forward with a considerable
degree of confidence to his safe return to the
coast. He was once more within the sphere of influence
of coast trade, where the European was better
known, and the hostile agency of the Moor was of small
account. There were no more jungles to cross, and he
was unaware of obstructing wars on the route. Through
good and evil report Karfa had remained his staunch
friend, and it was certain that now that his promised
reward was coming nearer and nearer attainment, he
would not alter in his honourable fidelity to his engagements.
It was now only a question of so many more
days’ journey till the Gambia would be reached, and all
Park’s cares and troubles be at an end.</p>

<p>On the 7th of May the slave caravan left Malacotta,
and resumed its journey to the coast. The Bali, a
branch of the Senegal, was crossed, and Bintingala
entered in the evening.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the 12th the Falemé River was
forded about 100 miles south of Park’s fording point
on his inland journey. At this place and time of year
the river was only two feet deep, flowing over a bed of
sand and gravel.</p>

<p>On the same day the caravan halted at the residence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
of a Mandingo merchant, who had his food served up in
pewter dishes in the European fashion. Next morning
they were joined by a Serawuli slave caravan. These
traders had the reputation of being infinitely more cruel
in their treatment of slaves than the Mandingoes. Park
was soon to see a sample of their ways. The caravan
was travelling with great speed through the dense woods,
when one of the slaves began to show signs of exhaustion,
and let his load fall from his head. A smart flogging
proved a temporary stimulant to the unhappy victim,
but hardly a mile was passed before nature once more
asserted itself, and again the load fell. A double dose
of the lash proved a second time effectual, and once
more the slave struggled painfully forward. At last
the limits of his powers were reached, and it became
clear that flog as they might he would remain immovable.</p>

<p>The caravan could not wait till he recovered, and
accordingly one of the Serawulis undertook to wait
and bring him to camp in the cool of the evening.
When the slave dealer did arrive in camp he came
alone. No questions were asked, but every one knew
that either the unfortunate man had been killed, or was
left to be devoured by wild beasts.</p>

<p>Other examples of the slave dealers’ methods were
almost daily exhibited before Park’s eyes. At one
place a Mandingo, having a slave torn from a neighbouring
district, agreed with Karfa to exchange him
for another from a more distant country, to which he
could not run away. The slave to be taken by Karfa
was called on a trivial pretext to come into the house.
The moment he entered the gate was shut, and he was
told to sit down. At once he saw the danger of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
situation&mdash;not only the more horrible fate of transportation
across the seas, but the loss of all chance of
escape to his native country. He would at least make
one effort for liberty. With the wild leap of a hunted
deer he cleared the fence of the court and bolted for
the woods. But it was useless. His enemies were too
many. A few minutes of wild flight, spurred on by
wolfish cries, and then he was hunted down and brought
back in irons to be handed over to Karfa.</p>

<p>At another place one of the male slaves in the caravan
was found to be too exhausted to proceed further in
spite of the usual physical stimulants. A townsman
was found willing to exchange him for a young girl.
No hint was given her of her approaching doom till the
last moment. Along with her companions she had come
to see the caravan depart, when all at once her master
seized her by the hand and delivered her to the slave
dealer. “Never was a face of serenity more suddenly
changed into one of the deepest distress. The terror she
manifested on having the load put upon her head and
the rope round her neck, and the sorrow with which she
bade adieu to her companions, were truly affecting.”</p>

<p>Incidents like these were what chiefly characterised
Park’s journey to the Gambia. At times the curious as
well as the horrible side of African life peeped out to
entertain him, as, for instance, when one of the slatees,
on returning for the first time to his native place after
an absence of three years, was met at the threshold of
his door by his bride-elect, who presented him with a
calabash of water in which to wash his hands. This
done, “the girl, with a tear of joy sparkling in her
eye, drank the water,” in token of her fidelity and
attachment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>Another of the slatees turned out to be an African
Enoch Arden. For eight long years he had stayed
away from his wife, during which time she heard
nothing from him. Concluding after three years that
he was either dead or not likely to return, she seemingly
without reluctance gave her heart and hand to
another, by whom she had two children. The first
husband now claimed her as his. The other objected
on the ground that a three years’ absence annulled a
marriage. For four days a public palaver was held to
settle this knotty point, ending in the decision that the
husbands had equal rights, and that the wife had best
settle the matter by making her own choice. The lady
asked time to consider, but Park could perceive that not
love but wealth would gain the day.</p>

<p>On the 20th of May the caravan entered the Tenda
Wilderness, where for two days they traversed dense
woods. With what pleasure must Park have noticed
that the country shelved towards the south-west&mdash;that
in fact he had entered the basin of the Gambia. At
sunset of the first day a pool was reached after a very
hot and trying march. To avoid the burning heats of
the day a night march was determined on. At eleven
o’clock the slaves were released from their irons and
driven forward in close order, as much to prevent them
escaping as to save them from wild beasts. In this
fashion they travelled till daybreak, after a rest continuing
the march to Tambakunda, the place almost
reached by Jobson nearly 170 years before, and which
he believed to be Timbuktu itself.</p>

<p>From Tambakunda the road led over a wild and rocky
country, everywhere rising into hills, and abounding
with monkeys and wild beasts. During the next two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
marches the reception everywhere met with by the
caravan was far from being hospitable, and they were
even in some danger of being plundered.</p>

<p>On the 30th of May the Nerico, a branch of the
Gambia, was reached. As soon as it was crossed the
singing men began to chant a song expressive of their
delight at having got safe into the “land of the setting
sun.” Next day, to his infinite joy, Park found himself
on the banks of the Gambia, at a point where it was
navigable, though lower down there were shallows.</p>

<p>Three days later, Medina, the capital of Wulli, was
reached, where Park had been so hospitably received
seventeen months before. The caravan did not halt
here; but Park, mindful of the old king’s prayer on his
behalf, sent word to him that his prayers had not been
unavailing.</p>

<p>Next day Jindeh was reached, where the parting
with Dr. Laidley had taken place. Here Karfa left
his slaves till a better opportunity of selling them had
arrived; but determined not to leave his white friend
till the last, he accompanied him on his way to Pisania.</p>

<p>Park at this point remarks: “Although I was
now approaching the end of my tedious and toilsome
journey, and expected in another day to meet with
countrymen and friends, I could not part for the last
time with my unfortunate fellow-travellers, doomed as
I knew most of them to be to a life of captivity and
slavery in a foreign land, without great emotion....
We parted with reciprocal expressions of regret
and benediction. My good wishes and prayers were
all that I could bestow upon them, and it afforded me
some consolation to be told that they were sensible I
had no more to give.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 10th, Park once more shook hands with one
of his countrymen. He found that it was universally
believed that he had met the same fate as Major
Houghton in Ludamar. He also learned with sincere
sorrow that neither Johnson, who had deserted him,
nor Demba, who had been enslaved by the Moors, had
returned.</p>

<p>On the 12th, Dr. Laidley joined the long-lost traveller,
and greeted him as one risen from the dead. Park was
soon, under his hospitable hands, divested of his ragged
Moorish garments. With them went the luxuriant
beard which had been the delight and admiration of
natives and Moors alike, among whom nothing is more
envied, and he stood forth once more the handsome
young Scotchman his portrait shows him to be.</p>

<p>Karfa was now paid off, the stipulated reward being
doubled, and Dr. Laidley’s interest also promised in
getting his slaves disposed of to advantage.</p>

<p>Karfa was never tired expressing his wonderment at
all he saw, though nothing surprised him more than the
incomprehensible madness of a person in Park’s condition
in life leaving all and suffering so many hardships
and dangers merely to see the river Niger. “I have
preserved,” says Park, “these little traits of character
in this worthy negro, not only from regard to the man,
but also because they appear to me to demonstrate that
he possessed a mind above his condition, and to such of
my readers as love to contemplate human nature in all
its varieties, and to trace its progress from rudeness to
refinement, I hope the account I have given of this poor
African will not be unacceptable.”</p>

<p>Looking back on his long and terrible journey, Park
could afford to take a lenient view of all the people who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
had plundered, ill-used, or inhospitably treated him,
except the Moors, of whom he carried a deep-rooted
horror and hatred to his dying day. For the Mandingoes
and kindred tribes he could ever find an excuse
for all he suffered at their hands, and as a people he
found them gentle, cheerful in their dispositions, kind-hearted,
and simple, with a natural sense of justice
which only very great temptation could overcome. He
could not find words strong enough to describe the
disinterested charity and tender solicitude shown by
many of them, especially the women, whom he found
to be universally kind and compassionate, sympathising
with his sufferings, relieving his distresses, and contributing
to his safety.</p>

<p>Reviewing what he had seen commercially, he found
that slaves, gold, and ivory, beeswax and honey, hides,
gums, and dye woods, constituted the whole catalogue
of exportable commodities. Of other products, such as
tobacco, indigo, and cotton, sufficient only was raised for
native consumption. He concluded, nevertheless, that
“it cannot, however, admit of a doubt that all the rich
and valuable productions both of the East and West
Indies might easily be naturalised and brought to the
utmost perfection in the tropical parts of this immense
continent. Nothing is wanting to this end but example
to enlighten the minds of the natives, and instruction to
enable them to direct their industry to proper objects.
It was not possible for me to behold the wonderful
fertility of the soil, the vast herds of cattle, proper both
for food and labour, and a variety of other circumstances
favourable to colonisation and agriculture, and
reflect withal on the means which presented themselves
of a vast inland navigation, without lamenting that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
country so abundantly gifted and favoured by nature
should remain in its present savage and neglected state.
Much more did I lament that a people of manners and
dispositions so gentle and benevolent should either be
left as they now are, immersed in the gross and uncomfortable
blindness of Pagan superstition, or permitted
to become converts to a system of bigotry and fanaticism
which, without enlightening the mind, often debases
the heart.” And yet which of the representatives of
the two religions, Islam and Christianity, were doing
the most good among the heathen according to Park’s
own showing&mdash;the Mohammedans, battling against the
inrushing tide of rum and gin, encouraging education,
and spreading a knowledge of Allah the One God; or
the Christian merchants, fomenting and deepening all
the horrors of native barbarism that their trade in
slaves might be kept up, and adding to the degradation
of the land by the drink and firearms they gave in
exchange for its people?</p>

<p>As there was no ship in the river when Park arrived,
he expected to have to wait for some months. In this,
however, he was happily disappointed, for an American
slave ship, the <i>Charlestown</i>, arrived on the 15th. Slaves
were plentiful, and in a couple of days the cargo of
human flesh and blood for the plantations of South
Carolina was made up in exchange for rum and tobacco.</p>

<p>Though the route by America was excessively circuitous,
it was such a chance as Park could not afford
to neglect. Accordingly, on the 17th of June he bade
farewell to all his English friends, and took passage in
the American vessel.</p>

<p>He had now reason to suppose that all his cares,
anxieties, and dangers were over, and nothing but rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
and good treatment before him. Once more, however,
he was dogged by his usual ill-luck. The passage
down the river was tedious and fatiguing, the weather
being exceedingly hot, moist, and unhealthy. The result
was that before Goree was reached, four of the seamen,
the surgeon, and three of the slaves had died of fever.
At Goree, owing to the difficulty of obtaining provisions,
the vessel was detained four weary months, so that it was
the end of October before she eventually set sail for
America.</p>

<p>The <i>Charlestown’s</i> cargo consisted of 130 slaves, of
whom twenty-five had been free Mohammedans, able to
read and write a little Arabic. Some of the others had
seen Park <i>en route</i>, and many had heard of him in their
distant villages. But though he had not a word to say
against the slave trade, Park had a feeling heart for the
miseries of those whom, with his Calvinistic ideas, he
believed predestined to a life of shame and suffering.
Being able to speak to them in their native language,
he did his best as a man and a doctor to comfort them.
And in truth they had need of all the consolation he
could bestow. The manner in which they were crowded,
confined, and chained in the hold of the ship produced
terrible sufferings, while the foul air, the wretched
sanitary conditions, and the want of exercise brought
on general sickness. “Besides the three who died on
the Gambia, and six or eight at Goree, eleven perished
at sea, and many of the survivors were reduced to a
very weak and emaciated condition.”</p>

<p>To make matters worse for all concerned, the <i>Charlestown</i>
sprang a leak three weeks from Goree, and threatened
to founder in mid-ocean. To avoid this, the ablest of
the negroes were taken from their chains and kept at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the pumps till they could be hounded on no longer, and
sank down exhausted and half dead. In spite of everything,
however, the leak continued to gain, and the
misery of all on board was indescribable. As affording
the only chance of safety, the <i>Charlestown</i> was turned
from its course and steered for Antigua, which was
reached thirty-five days out from Goree. But even in
sight of harbour the ship narrowly escaped destruction
by striking on a sunken rock.</p>

<p>Park remained at Antigua for two days, when on
the 24th November he was taken up by a passing mail
ship. After a short but tempestuous voyage he arrived
at Falmouth on the 22nd December, having been absent
from England two years and nine months.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>MUNGO PARK AT HOME.</i></span></h2>

<p>Once landed at Falmouth, Park lost no time in proceeding
to London. In those days there was no telegraph
to apprise the world of his arrival, nor newspaper
reporters to interview him, and give their readers a
description of his appearance and a foretaste of his
adventures.</p>

<p>He reached London before daybreak on the 25th
December, and directed his steps to the house of his
brother-in-law, Mr. Dickson. Not caring to disturb his
relative at that early hour, he wandered about the
streets for some time, till finding one of the gates to the
British Museum Gardens open, he entered.</p>

<p>As it happened, Dickson had charge of these gardens,
and on this particular morning had business which took
him there unusually early. Conceive his amazement
on coming face to face with what for a moment he
almost took to be a vision or ghost of his young relative,
long since believed to be dead. It did not take long to
convince him, however, that here was no ghost, but the
actual traveller himself, safe and well, his great mission
carried through to a successful conclusion.</p>

<p>The interest, delight, and surprise of the Association,
as well as of the public generally, were no less keen.
For some time it had been looked on as a certainty that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
he had been murdered, and now the utmost curiosity
prevailed to hear his adventures, and at last learn
something authentic about the mysterious river of the
negroes.</p>

<p>It looked indeed as if Park’s own prediction to his
brother before leaving for Africa, that he would “acquire
a greater name than any ever did,” was to be verified.
In the absence of more definite news, the hand to
hand reports which circulated only tended to exaggerate
his feats and discoveries.</p>

<p>So eager became the demand for information that it
was determined to issue a preliminary report of the
principal geographical results of the expedition. This
was written by Bryan Edwards, the Secretary of the
Association, a gentleman of no inconsiderable literary
attainments, and author of a “History of the British
Colonies in the West Indies.”</p>

<p>To the collaboration of Edwards was added that of
Major Rennell, who worked out with very great care
the traveller’s routes, and the geography of the region
generally. In addition, Rennell added a memoir on the
upper course of the Niger beyond Park’s furthest point,
collating with his information that of the Arabian
geographers.</p>

<p>But the public demanded something more than the
dry bones of geography to satisfy their hungry appetite.
They wanted also the flesh and blood of his narrative&mdash;how
he lived and moved, what he felt and suffered,
what dangers he faced, what hardships endured, the
wonders he saw. Books of travel had not then deluged
the market and saturated men’s minds with details
about the remotest corners of Inner Africa. It was
practically virgin soil to the reader, who could in nowise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
guess beforehand what startling revelations were in
store for him. Compared with the modern devourer
of books of travel, his sensations would be as those
of the first explorer of the Gambia to the subdued
expectancy of our latest traveller.</p>

<p>To gratify this very natural curiosity Park now
devoted himself. His materials, apart from his memory,
were but scanty. They consisted, in fact, of short notes
or memoranda, written on odds and ends of paper,
which must often have been far from legible, considering
how they were carried for months in the crown of
a battered hat, exposed to damp and all manner of
accidents.</p>

<p>In the task of authorship Park was no doubt
materially aided by Mr. Edwards, with whom he lived
on terms of great friendship. In one or two places
the pen of Edwards is clearly traceable, but these are
few and far between. Where he lent the most valuable
assistance was in the pruning, rearrangement, and revision
which the work of a novice in composition would
almost necessarily require. In this respect, however,
Park is not alone among travellers. Few indeed among
them have had such a complete mastery of the pen
and of the English language as to trust absolutely in
their own literary powers and judgment, although, as
in Park’s case, the assistance required has seldom gone
beyond guidance and revision.</p>

<p>Apart from his literary influence, it can hardly be
doubted that Edwards very materially moulded Park’s
views on at least one important subject&mdash;the slave trade.
At that time the question of abolition had become a
burning one in the country, and Edwards was one of
the warmest advocates of the old order of things. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
would give Africa Light, but no Liberty. While actively
employed in trying to open up the Dark Continent to
European influence, he strenuously strove to ensure
that that influence should remain of the most criminal
and degrading nature.</p>

<p>Let the reader imagine what would have been the
consequence to Africa if the advocates of slavery had
had their way, and the exploration of the Continent
had only been the forerunner of more widespread ramifications
of the slave trade. However incredible it may
appear, such might easily have been the case. People
once accustomed to an evil soon forget that it is such,
and begin to look upon it as one of the necessary and
unavoidable ills of life. Take, for example, the survival
of the African gin trade to this very day, increasing
and flourishing long after its dissociation from its well-matched
sister traffic in slaves, and everywhere dogging
the explorer’s footsteps. It is doubtful if even the slave
trade has done more to brutalise and degrade the negro;
and yet even in our time there is only a partial awakening
to the frightful evils of the iniquitous traffic.</p>

<p>This culpable blindness or carelessness on our part is
doubtless largely fostered by the comforting and comfortable
belief that our missionaries are doing a great
and noble work in Africa, and that mere contact with
the European and European commerce must of necessity
have an elevating effect upon the lower races. The truth
is that for every negro nominally or genuinely brought
under the influence of Christianity, ten thousand have
been driven by drink to depths of moral and physical
depravity unheard of among uncontaminated native
tribes, and that so far contact with the European
and his commerce has resulted not in elevation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
the African, but in degradation of the most loathsome
kind.</p>

<p>To what extent Park was really influenced in his
opinions on the slave question by Edwards it would be
difficult to say. It matters little, however, for whether
he really believed in the righteousness of slavery or was
merely reasoned into neutrality, his position was equally
indefensible. Nay, more, if, as his friends say, he really
believed that the trade was an unjust one, the position
he assumed was nothing more nor less than criminal.
These urge, as if it were an extenuating circumstance,
that in private conversation he even expressed the
greatest abhorrence of the traffic. This, it must be confessed,
seems improbable. Such an attitude is utterly
unlike what we should expect from a man of Park’s
marked individuality and strong earnest truthfulness.
Moreover, it seems sufficiently clear that the public
opinion of his day ascribed to him a belief in the
righteousness of the principle of slavery, and if it was
wrong, it seems strange that he took no means to correct
it. But that it was not wrong seems evident from
a speech delivered on the Abolition of the Slave Trade
by George Hibbert in Parliament in 1803.</p>

<p>The following is an extract&mdash;valuable, too, as throwing
light upon the share of Edwards in the writing of Park’s
book:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have read and heard that we are to look to Park’s
facts and not to his opinions; and it has been insinuated
that his editor, Mr. Edwards, had foisted those
opinions (relating to the slave trade) into his book. It
happened to me once to converse with Mr. Park at a
meeting of the Linnean Society, when this very topic
was started, and he assured me that, not being in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
habit of literary composition, he was obliged to employ
some one to put his manuscript into a form fit for the
public eye, but that every sheet of the publication had
undergone his strict revision, and that not only every
fact but every sentiment was his own.”</p>

<p>We must, therefore, till more convincing proof than
hearsay evidence is forthcoming, believe that Mungo
Park was a believer in the slave trade. Such a position
we can understand and make all due allowance for
as the result of the ideas of the time, and of those by
whom he was immediately surrounded&mdash;to believe else
were to place Park on a distinctly lower pedestal than
that to which he is entitled by his many meritorious
characteristics.</p>

<p>Shortly after the publication of the abstract of Park’s
narrative, he left London on a visit to his family at
Foulshiels, where his mother still lived, though his
father had been dead for some years. Here he remained
the whole of the summer and autumn of 1798, working
assiduously at the narrative of his travels. This was
probably anything but an agreeable task to him after
the eventful life he had led for three years, and unaccustomed
as he was to literary work. But Park was
not the man to shirk any work, however irksome, if it
in any way appeared to him in the light of a duty.
His mornings he devoted to writing, his evenings to
strolls along the bank of his much-loved Yarrow, where,
rarely troubled by native or by passing stranger, he
could undisturbed recall the various events which
marked his African wanderings, and on the dreamy
rush of the mountain stream let his thoughts glide
back to the majestic sweep of the Joliba moving
eastward towards its unknown bourne. What hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
he must have spent thus, seeking in his mind’s eye
to pierce the dark veil which so mysteriously shrouded
the great African river beyond Timbuktu, and follow it
to its union with the ocean, or its gradual disappearance
in the Central Deserts.</p>

<p>At times restlessness and a feeling of revolt took
possession of him, and then the only charm that could
exorcise the demon of unrest within him or soothe his
wild vague longings, was a long swift walk among the
wild romantic scenery around. Up Yarrow’s winding
dale, on the bold front of Newark Hill, or the heathery
summit of the Broomy Law, his was the keen pleasure
of a soul that knows “a rapture on the lonely shore.”
The distant bleat of sheep, the plaintive call of the
curlew, and the whirr of grouse, harmonised well with
the mood possessing him, and touched his heart with
the wild pathos of Nature. Happiest when alone, he
found companions in all the sounds around him. The
breeze, the rushing stream, the wild calls of bird and
beast, all alike spoke to him, and adapted themselves to
his every mood.</p>

<p>All this may be vaguely discerned by virtue of the
gleams of light which have momentarily shot across the
darkness of the past, and preserved a blurred though
speaking print of the great traveller at home among his
native hills.</p>

<p>But although thus isolated from the world at large,
Park was not entirely cut off from communication with
his fellow-men. His chief resort when in a mood for
society was the house of his friend and master in
medicine, Dr. Anderson, who still practised in Selkirk,
within easy reach of Foulshiels. As one result of these
frequent visits, the friendship of former days for Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Anderson speedily developed into a warmer feeling, and
summer saw them engaged.</p>

<p>Towards the latter part of 1798, Park returned to
London to make the final arrangements for the publication
of his narrative. Even then, however, much had
to be done with the assistance of Edwards before the
manuscript was finally ready for the press, and spring
had come before the book saw the light.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to overestimate the enthusiasm
with which it was received, or the interest in Park and
Africa which it aroused. Two editions were sold off in
rapid succession, and were followed by several others in
the course of the following ten years.</p>

<p>Apart from its being almost the first of African books
of travel, and from the absolute novelty of all it contained,
the narrative was told with a charm and <i>naïveté</i>
in themselves sufficient to captivate the most fastidious
reader. Modesty and truthfulness peeped from every
sentence. Its author claimed no praise, no admiration,
beyond that due to him for having done his duty. He
took to himself no credit for all the virtues he had
shown. So afraid was he indeed that he might be
charged with being the author of what are called
“travellers’ tales,” that he deliberately suppressed
several remarkable adventures. On this point he said
to Sir Walter Scott, “that in all cases where he had
information to communicate which he thought of importance
to the public, he had stated the facts boldly,
leaving it to his readers to give such credit to his
statements as they might appear justly to deserve, but
that he would not shock their credulity or render his
travels more marvellous by introducing circumstances
which, however true, were of little or no moment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>Happily his narrative required no aid from such suppressed
adventures, however strange they might be, or
however much we should have liked to know them.
He had incident enough to make half-a-dozen of the
spun out books of modern travel. Neither then nor
since has any African explorer had such a romantic
tale to tell, nor has any out of all the long list of
adventurers who have followed told his tale so well.
Some there have been who have flourished more theatrically
across the African stage, and by virtue of
striking dramatic effects, and a certain spice of bloodshed,
have struck the imagination of those who are
content with the superficial show of things, and are
not too critical as to their significance. But for
actual hardships undergone, for dangers faced, and
difficulties overcome, together with an exhibition of the
virtues which make a man great in the rude battle of
life, Mungo Park stands without a rival. In one respect
only&mdash;that of motive&mdash;does another surpass him.
Here Livingstone stands head and shoulders above his
predecessor, whose aspirations after personal name and
fame, and apathetic attitude towards the anti-slavery
movement, will ill bear comparison with the noble
longings which inspired the great missionary to travel,
that the negro heathen might be brought within the
pale of Christian brotherhood, and stirred him to the
consecration of his life in healing “the great open sore
of the Universe.”</p>

<p>Not that Park was altogether awanting in all that
tends towards the spirit of self-sacrifice. On the contrary,
throughout his whole narrative we fail to find
the faintest trace of vulgar ambition or ignoble self-seeking.
He deliberately suppressed incidents which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
would have added greatly to his fame, especially among
those whose imagination is only appealed to by the
marvellous. His whole nature shrank from notoriety.
He was retired and reserved in manner, and instead of
seeking to play the <i>rôle</i> of the “lion” in society, we find
that he always looked forward to a time when, his labours
ended, he should be able to seek the seclusion and retirement
of the country&mdash;scarcely the goal this of a merely
selfish ambition.</p>

<p>As little was he actuated by the desire of gain, as
Ruskin would have us believe. Except perhaps in one
conspicuous instance, African travel has never been
known to lead to the attainment of riches, and certainly
to Park money was never held out as an inducement.
The spark that quickened his manhood to
heroism, and fired him “to scorn delights and live
laborious days,” was the worthy ambition of a noble
mind to work for the good of his country and the
advancement of knowledge, rewarded solely by the
approbation of his own conscience and the esteem of
good men.</p>

<p>It is to be remembered that a hundred years ago
Christian philanthropy had not become so cosmopolitan&mdash;so
world-embracing&mdash;as to take within its sphere all
who bear the name of man, without respect of race,
religion, or degree of civilisation. From what we know
of his intense religious convictions and kindly nature,
Park, had he lived at the present day, would probably
have been a missionary aflame for the cause of Christ
and ready to lay down his life for it, or a traveller
preaching a crusade, not only against the slave trade,
which is so often ignorantly ascribed to the influence
of Islam, but against the gin trade likewise, which with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
quite as much plausibility might be associated with
Christianity.</p>

<p>At the period of the publication of Park’s narrative
the question of Abolition was in every man’s mind.
The horrors of the middle passage&mdash;the iniquities perpetrated
in the plantations by men calling themselves
Englishmen&mdash;were being painted in colours by no means
too dark. Park’s book came opportunely to add to the
literature of the subject, and undoubtedly, in spite of
the anti-abolition opinions he was believed to hold, the
facts he disclosed regarding the horrors of the slave
route added materially to the arguments of the Abolitionists.
Coming, indeed, as was believed, from one of
the opposite party, they were of all the more value, the
natural assumption being that the worst aspects had
been softened down and as good a case made out for
slavery as was possible without direct violation of the
truth. It was abundantly clear to all unprejudiced
minds that the conditions under which the trade was
carried on, and the evil results flowing from it as described
by Park, were iniquitous and shameful in the
extreme. To such Park’s opinions were of small account
compared with his facts, and we may safely conclude
that these latter very materially contributed to the
sweeping away of the vile traffic.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>MUNGO PARK AT HOME&mdash;(Continued).</i></span></h2>

<p>After the publication of his narrative there was nothing
to detain Park longer in London, while there was much
to attract him to Scotland. Accordingly he returned to
Foulshiels in the summer of 1799.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of August of that year he was married
to Miss Anderson. Of the personality of this lady we
know little beyond the simple facts that she was tall
and handsome, amiable in disposition, with no special
mental endowments, and if anything somewhat frivolous
and pleasure-loving&mdash;characteristics very unlike what
we should have expected in the wife of such a man as
Park.</p>

<p>In personal appearance the young explorer must have
been quite a match for his wife. The portrait of him
which has come down to us shows a head of noble proportions.
The fine brow speaks of his mental powers;
the prominent, finely chiselled nose, firm, well-shaped
mouth, and powerful jaws, indicate the iron will and
marked individuality which he showed himself to possess.
No less striking and attractive are the eyes, which
look forth so calmly, aglow with truthfulness, self-possession,
and confidence. In person he was tall, reaching
quite six feet, and exceedingly well proportioned. His
whole appearance was prepossessing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>It is impossible to say what were Park’s plans for his
future life when he took to himself a wife. Probably
they were but ill-defined even to himself. It may be
safely concluded, however, that he had then no intention
of returning to Africa. All the horrors of his recent
experiences were still too strongly upon him to make
the idea of a new journey welcome. Moreover, the after
penalty of those months of starvation and atrocious
fare had still to be paid by inveterate dyspepsia and its
concomitant evils of gloom and despondency. While
under its influence his sleep was much broken, and too
often night was made one hideous nightmare by dreams
of being back once more in captivity among the Moors
of Ludamar, and subjected to the old tortures and
indignities.</p>

<p>Probably, therefore, when he married, he did so in
the belief that there would be no occasion for separation&mdash;no
likelihood of his ever entering upon any engagements
which should make him unable to fulfil his duty to his
wife as a loving, ever-present protector and support.</p>

<p>At no time does Park ever seem to have been enamoured
of his profession, and after the life he had
recently led he felt a repugnance to settling down to
its uncongenial routine.</p>

<p>For the moment, however, he did not feel called upon
to come to an immediate decision as to his future work
in life. The liberal remuneration which he had received
from the African Association, together with the profits
of his book, had placed him for the time being in easy
circumstances. He could therefore afford to wait to
see what might turn up. He had become well known.
He had powerful friends. There was accordingly every
likelihood that something congenial would be found for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
him. Meanwhile he resolved to settle down quietly at
Foulshiels.</p>

<p>At this period his mother was still alive, and the
farm was worked by one of his brothers. Most of the
family had done well. One sister, as we have already
seen, had married Mr. Dickson, who had risen both to
moderate affluence and to considerable fame as a botanist.
Another had found a husband in a well-to-do farmer
in the neighbourhood. His brother Adam had gone
through the same course as himself, and had become
established as a doctor in Gravesend; while a second
brother, Alexander, had been made under-sheriff for the
county, the sheriff-principal being Sir Walter Scott.</p>

<p>Of this brother Scott himself gives us a sketch in
his introduction to the “Lady of the Lake,” when recalling
his doubts of the poem’s success:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I remember that about the same time a friend
(Arch. Park) started in to ‘heeze up my hope,’ like the
sportsman with his cutty gun in the old song. He was
bred a farmer, but a man of powerful understanding,
natural good taste, and warm poetical feeling, perfectly
competent to supply the wants of an imperfect or irregular
education. He was a passionate admirer of field
sports, which we often pursued together.” And then
Scott goes on to tell how he was in the habit of reading
the poem to him to experiment as to the effect produced
on one who was “but too favourable a representative of
readers at large.” Archibald Park remained in Scott’s
employment for many years, and was frequently his
companion in his mountain rides.</p>

<p>In 1799, the Government made certain proposals to
Park relative to his going out in some official capacity
to New South Wales. Of this, however, nothing came,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
though whether the fault lay with the Government or
with the explorer is not known.</p>

<p>The natural consequences of idleness to a man of
Park’s personality and past life soon became apparent.
With a wife of no particular depth of character and
no special mental attainments, however attractive and
amiable she might otherwise be, there could be but
small absorption of his thoughts. With no other
society, and no work to keep him occupied, there could
be but one result&mdash;restlessness and revolt against the
position in which he found himself, and the gradual
upgrowth of the old longings and ideas&mdash;the irrepressible
fever of travel. Coincidently he began to forget
the hardships and dangers he had experienced, and as
they grew less and less vivid, and gradually dropped
into the background of his memory, the fascination of
discovery, of travel in strange lands and among strange
peoples&mdash;the wish to settle the unsolved mystery of the
Niger&mdash;began anew to assert their power and possess
him with ever-growing force.</p>

<p>For the time the African Association was resting on
their oars as far as prosecuting their work from West
Africa was concerned, though in 1798 Horneman had
been despatched to penetrate to the Sudan from Egypt.</p>

<p>No doubt this was partly due to the enormous difficulties
and ever present dangers which Park had described,
partly also perhaps on account of the war then being
waged with France.</p>

<p>In 1800 Goree had been captured, an event which
inspired Park to write (July 31, 1800) to Sir Joseph
Banks, pointing out its importance in relation to renewed
attempts to penetrate the interior of the Continent.
After describing his views on the subject, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
adds&mdash;“If such are the views of Government, I hope that
my exertions in some station or other may be of use to
my country.”</p>

<p>In 1801 the negotiations with the Government relative
to the New South Wales mission were resumed.
A visit to London was found necessary for a satisfactory
discussion of the matter, and accordingly we find Park
in the metropolis in the early spring.</p>

<p>How deep and tender was his affection for his winsome
wife is shown in a letter written to her during the
visit&mdash;one of the few glimpses that have come down to us
of the more private side of the explorer’s character.</p>

<p>The letter is dated March 12th, 1801, and is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My lovely Ailie</span>,&mdash;Nothing gives me more pleasure
than to write to you, and the reason why I delayed it a
day last time was to get some money to send to you.
You say you are wishing to spend a note upon yourself.
My sweet Ailie, you may be sure I approve of it. What
is mine is yours, and I receive much pleasure from your
goodness in consulting me about such a trifle. I wish I
had thousands to give you, but I know that my Ailie
will be contented with what we have, and we shall live
in the hope of seeing better days. I long very much to
be with you, my love, and I was in great hopes of having
things settled before now, but Sir Joseph (Banks) is ill,
and I can do nothing till he recovers.</p>

<p>“I am happy to know you will go to New South
Wales with me, my sweet wife. You are everything
that I could desire; and wherever we go, you may be
sure of one thing, that I shall always love you. Whenever
I have fixed on this or any other situation I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
write to you. In the meantime, let nobody know till
things are settled, as there is much between the cup and
the lip.</p>

<p>“My lovely Ailie, you are constantly in my thoughts.
I am tired of this place, but cannot lose the present
opportunity of doing something for our advantage.
When that is accomplished I shall not lose one moment.
My darling, when we meet I shall be the happiest man
on earth. Write soon, for I count the days till I hear
from you, my lovely Ailie.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Again the negotiations with the Government fell
through, and there was nothing for it but for Park
to return once more to Foulshiels disappointed and discouraged,
but possessed more than ever by the fever of
unrest&mdash;more and more under the influence of the Niger
magnet&mdash;against which the sole counteracting forces
were love for his wife, the dread of being separated
from her, and his duty as a husband.</p>

<p>It was in this not very suitable mood that he was
forced to face the fact that he must no longer depend
on the vague hope of finding a congenial opening, but
must put his hand to something, however alien to his
tastes and aspirations. For a time he thought of taking
a farm, but at last reluctantly came to the conclusion
that his best course would be to resume his profession
as a doctor. An opening presented itself in the neighbouring
town of Peebles, where he went to reside in
the month of October, occupying a house at the head
of the Brygate, while his surgery was a small projecting
building&mdash;since demolished&mdash;east from the first
Chambers’ Institute. In a lane behind was his humble
laboratory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p><div class="center">
<img id="i_201" src="images/i_201.png" width="600" height="384" alt="" />
<p class="caption">EXTRACT OF MUNGO PARK’S LETTER TO HIS WIFE.</p></div>

<p>Park threw himself into his work with characteristic
energy and thoroughness, and speedily won for himself
a fair share of the practice of the town and country.
The profits, however, were of the poorest, and the work
of the hardest&mdash;so much so, indeed, that he once said to
Scott he “would rather brave Africa and all its horrors
than wear out his life in long and toilsome rides over
cold and lonely heaths and gloomy hills, assailed by the
wintry tempest, for which the remuneration was hardly
enough to keep soul and body together.”</p>

<p>On the strength of this reported offhand remark,
Ruskin, without troubling to inquire further into the
history of the man, has formulated the following indictment.
This “terrific” sentence, he says, “signifies, if
you look into it, almost total absence of the instinct of
personal duty&mdash;total absence of belief in the God who
chose for him his cottage birthplace and set him his
life task beside it; absolute want of interest in his profession,
of sense for natural beauty, and of compassion
for the noblest poor of his native land. And with these
absences there is the clearest evidence of the fatalist of
the vices, Avarice&mdash;in the exact form in which it was
the ruin of Scott himself&mdash;the love of money for the
sake of worldly position.”</p>

<p>Never was more sweeping accusation founded on
more slender data. Practically, Park is charged with
absence of a belief in God, and of a sense of duty to
his fellows, because he finds his profession toilsome and
uncongenial.</p>

<p>The argument seems to be that the man is an atheist
and a sinner against society who is not content to
remain in the sphere in which he was born, and in
which accordingly his life task is divinely set.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>Were such a position tenable, it is difficult to see how
any progress, either personal or social, would be possible.
From it, in the present instance, would naturally
follow that Park was as little to be justified in choosing
to be a doctor rather than a peasant farmer, as in preferring
to be an explorer rather than either.</p>

<p>What Ruskin takes exception to, however, is not
Park’s choosing a profession, but that the choice once
made, he should seek to abandon it. But if it were
permissible to him as a youth, ignorant alike of himself,
the world, and the profession he was about to enter,
to choose, surely it was equally permissible that as a
man, with some knowledge of all three, he should withdraw
in favour of the work to which he knew himself
adapted. The instinct and capacities which fitted him
for an explorer were as divinely implanted as his birthplace
had been divinely appointed. Moreover, those
“noblest poor of his native land,” to whom Ruskin so
pathetically refers, were not alone dependent on Park
for medical aid&mdash;a circumstance which would have lent
another colour to his final resolve to forsake them.
Doctors there were in plenty, alike able and willing to
serve them; but there was but one Mungo Park&mdash;but
one man, as far as was known, who by his special gifts
and wide experience was suited for the peculiar and
arduous work of African exploration. Upon him then
it devolved, with all the sacrednesss of a divinely appointed
mission, as indeed he deemed it, and accepted it
accordingly, to the exclusion of all narrower obligations.</p>

<p>There still remains the charge of Avarice, based on
Park’s simple statement that his “unceasing toil was
hardly sufficient to keep soul and body together.” Is
then the physician less entitled than say the author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
to a just remuneration for his services, or does Ruskin
share the not uncommon popular delusion that though
butchers’ and bakers’ bills demand immediate attention,
the payment of the doctor’s is to be regarded as
optional, or subject to the convenience of the patient.
Neither supposition is to be entertained for a moment.
Indeed the charge rests upon too flimsy a foundation
ever to be taken seriously by any unprejudiced mind,
and we can only regretfully wonder what could have
induced Mr. Ruskin so far to forget the Justice and
Charity he is so fond of preaching as to bring it forward.</p>

<p>Beyond the record of “unceasing toil” little is known
of how Park spent the time he was resident in Peebles.
The town itself is described as being in those days
“quiet as the grave”&mdash;a reputation it still maintains,
judging from the innuendo in the ironical phrase,
“Peebles for pleasure!”</p>

<p>To Park, however, the absence of the brighter aspect
of life was a small matter. Society had but little attraction
for him, and his was the severe Scottish nature
which avoided as almost sinful anything bordering upon
frivolous pleasure. From all lionising and the silly
questioning of the ignorant and the impertinently
curious he had a natural shrinking, though at any time
delighted to talk of his travels and of matters African
with the intelligent and the well-informed. Quiet and
seclusion were, however, more to his mind, and were
to be enjoyed to the full in the peaceful little town.
Such society as he wanted he had in his own domestic
circle, beyond which he was happy in the intimacy
which sprang up between him and two distinguished
residents&mdash;Colonel John Murray of Kringaltie and Dr.
Adam Ferguson, formerly Professor of Moral Philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
in Edinburgh, and author of several well-known works.
Toilsome and monotonous as was his professional life,
it was not without its brighter and more humorous side,
as witness the following story told by Dr. Anderson,
the nephew of Park’s wife:&mdash;</p>

<p>“One wild night in winter Park lost his way, till
discovering a light, he directed his horse towards it, and
found himself before a shepherd’s cottage. It so happened
that the Doctor arrived there in the nick of time,
for the shepherd’s wife was on the point of confinement.
He waited till all was safely over, and next morning
the shepherd escorted him to where he could see the
distant road. Park, noticing his conductor lag behind,
asked him the reason, on which the simple or humorous
man replied, ‘’Deed, sir, my wife said she was sure you
must be an angel, and I think sae tae; so I am just
keepin’ ahint to be sure I’ll see you flee up.’”</p>

<p>As time went on, Park’s longing to return to Africa
grew ever more intense, nourished as it was by hopes
from time to time held out to him. Barely, for instance,
had he settled down to life in Peebles, when he
received a letter from Sir Joseph Banks, acquainting
him that in consequence of the Peace (then recently
signed with France), the Association intended to revive
their project of sending a mission to Africa in
order to penetrate to and navigate the Niger. If
Government took up the matter, Park would certainly
be recommended as the person proper to be employed
for carrying it into execution. As with previous projects,
however, nothing came of it for the time being,
though it continued to be talked about more or less
during the next two years.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1803 he was desired by the Colonial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Office to repair without delay to London. This summons
he promptly obeyed. On his arrival he had an interview
with the Earl of Buckingham, the Secretary for
the Colonies, who informed him that the Government
had resolved on fitting out an expedition to Africa, of
which he was to have the command, if he was willing to
take it. It was exactly what he wanted&mdash;exactly what
he had been impatiently awaiting for three years; but
nevertheless he asked for a short time to think the
matter over and consult his friends. The favour was
granted, and he returned to Scotland. The consultations
referred to being for the most part a mere formality,
in a few days his acceptance was forwarded to
London, whither he followed immediately after arranging
his affairs and taking leave of his family.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>PREPARING FOR A NEW EXPEDITION.</i></span></h2>

<p>In this as in his earlier expedition, Park was dogged by
his usual ill-luck.</p>

<p>Disappointment met him at the very outset.</p>

<p>He had left Scotland in the belief that almost every
arrangement had been made, and that a very short time
would suffice to complete the necessary preparations.</p>

<p>He arrived in London only to hear that the departure
of the expedition had been postponed till the end
of February 1804. With what patience he possessed
he waited. The allotted time went by. Once more
everything was ready. Part of the troops destined for
the service were actually on board ship, when orders
came countermanding the expedition, pending the decision
of Lord Camden, the new Colonial Secretary, as to
whether it should go at all or not.</p>

<p>Park was naturally bitterly disappointed at thus being
thrown again on the seas of uncertainty. The expedition
might now never set out, and the task of solving the
great African problem would be reserved for another.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the date of departure was provisionally
put off till September, and till then he was recommended
to return to Scotland and occupy the interval
in perfecting himself in taking astronomical observations
and in learning Arabic&mdash;acquirements which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
would be of the utmost importance to him afterwards.</p>

<p>A suitable teacher of Arabic was found in one Sidi
Ambak Bubi, a native of Mogador, and then residing in
London. Accompanied by the Moor, Park returned to
Peebles in March. Here he remained till May, when he
finally quitted that town and took up his residence at
Foulshiels while awaiting the decision of the Colonial
Office.</p>

<p>It was at this time that the great traveller came in
contact with his still greater countryman and neighbour,
Sir Walter Scott, then living at Ashesteil, and separated
from Foulshiels only by the sharp ridge of hills
which divides the Yarrow from the Tweed.</p>

<p>Between two such men&mdash;the one absorbed in a career
of prospective action in a new continent, the other revelling
in a romantic world of retrospective thought&mdash;it
might be supposed there was little in common.</p>

<p>In reality there was much. Scott, though he delighted
to sing of the past and conjure up its knightly deeds,
had a soul capable of appreciating all forms of glorious
and adventurous enterprise, whether seen in the prosaic
lights of the passing moment, or invested with the
romantic vagueness and fascinating glamour which the
shades of time gather around bygone days. To such an
one Park was a man after his own heart. Had but his
deeds been surrounded with the pomp and circumstance
which glorified those of the knights of old, Scott might
have sung them in a similar heroic strain. Mayhap
the day will come when another Scott will arise to
do for Park and his successors what Sir Walter and
others have done for the heroic figures of our nation’s
history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, Park, imbued as he likewise was
with the romantic instinct, could not fail to be attracted
by Scott’s peculiar genius. Moreover, both were Scotchmen,
both Borderers, and both alike were passionate
lovers of the minstrelsy, tales, traditions, and ballads of
their native country. The ballads especially were dear
to Park, and he tells how, in his last expedition, one of
his followers used “to beguile the watches of the night
with the songs of our dear native land.”</p>

<p>But whatever were the links which drew these two
famous men together, they were sufficient speedily to
develop a very warm and cordial friendship, and visits
were frequently interchanged across the heathery hills
which separated them. On one of these occasions Scott
discovered Park sitting alone beside the noisy Yarrow,
employed in the apparently idle and boyish amusement
of throwing stones into the river and anxiously watching
the bubbles as they rose to the surface. On being asked
what interest he found in such a pastime, Park replied
that he was thus in the habit of ascertaining the depth
of rivers in Africa before venturing to cross them&mdash;the
time taken by the bubbles to rise being an indication of
the depth.</p>

<p>Early in September came the long expected summons
to repair to London, and Park lost no time in settling
his affairs preparatory to leaving home. Among others,
he paid a farewell visit to Sir Walter Scott at Ashesteil,
where he spent the night. Next morning his host
accompanied him on his way to Foulshiels. The path
lay up the Glenkinnen to Williamhope, whence it continued
over the ridge and passed between the Brown
Knowe and the humpy elevation of the Broomy Law.
As they passed from the birchen slopes of Glenkinnen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
into the heather and grass-clad zones above, Park talked
much of his plans of exploration, and the results that
would accrue to science and commerce should he prove
successful.</p>

<p>Under other conditions the panorama which slowly
unfolds itself with the ascent of the hill would have been
sufficient to draw even Park’s thoughts from Africa and
the Niger. The various glens and valleys of the Tweed,
the Gala, the Yarrow, and the Ettrick divide the land
into a picturesque succession of winding ridges, isolated
hills, and rounded mountain tops, where wood, heather,
and grass give variety of colour to the higher levels,
while below waving crops and busy harvest-fields, ruined
castle and noble mansion, humble cottage and straggling
village, with glancing bits of stream and river, flocks of
sheep and scattered herds of cattle, combine to produce
the softer effects of “cultivated nature.”</p>

<p>But on this day of leave-taking a leaden-coloured mist
hung over hill and valley, hiding their every feature.
Only now and again did the breeze lift a corner of the
enshrouding veil and give a momentary glimpse, vague
and fleeting, of glen and hill-top. As they talked of
the coming journey Scott seemed to see in the vaguely
defined landscape an emblem of his friend’s prospects,
where all was problematic, uncertain&mdash;the path beset
with unknown dangers and pitfalls, nothing sure save
the presence of surrounding perils which might neither
be foreseen nor prepared for. In this ignorance as regards
the exact nature of the dangers to be faced lies
one of the chief difficulties and terrors of travel in unexplored
savage lands. All the traveller does know is
that dangers in various forms will most assuredly confront
him, and he must depend upon his presence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
mind and readiness of resource at the moment to avoid
or repel them.</p>

<p>But Park was not to be debarred from his enterprise
by any thought of the difficulties in the way. To all
that Scott could urge he had his answer. The idea of
solving the question of the Niger’s termination was one
which possessed him to the exclusion of all thoughts of
self. As well have asked him to renounce his belief in
the existence of God as expect him to give up his
cherished scheme.</p>

<p>At last the glen of the Yarrow lay before them. At
the bottom could be hazily defined the “birchen bower,”
from which the stately tower of Newark and the humble
cottage of Foulshiels alike looked forth on the beautiful
murmurous stream.</p>

<p>Here they must say good-bye. A ditch divided the
road from the moor, and in crossing it Park’s horse
stumbled and nearly fell. “I am afraid, Mungo,” said
Scott, “that is a bad omen.” “Freits” (<i>i.e.</i>, omens)
“follow those who look to them,” was the prompt reply;
and without another word Park rode away and disappeared
in the mist.</p>

<p>It now only remained to Park to take farewell of his
wife. Brave as he was, the ordeal was more than he
dared face. Not that she had raised any objections to
his going, or put any barriers in the way. Seeing how
much her husband’s heart was in it, and not perhaps
without some natural womanly pride in being the wife
of a hero rather than of a nobody, she seems to have
accepted as a matter of course his determination to
avail himself of the chance of further distinction presented
by the proposed expedition. Still, the moment
of actual parting, with the prospect of at best a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
period of separation, would be agony. Even better than
his wife Park knew how many chances there were that
the separation might be final&mdash;that wife and children,
of whom there were now three, might never see him
again. Sanguine as he was of success, there were
moments when he could not but admit that the coming
enterprise looked very like a forlorn hope&mdash;moments,
too, when it became difficult for him to discern whether
his duty to humanity or to his family had the stronger
claim upon him.</p>

<p>It was under the influence of some such feeling of
despondency that he finally resolved to spare both
himself and his wife the anguish of a parting scene,
and betaking himself to Edinburgh on the plea of
business, thence wrote to her his last farewell.</p>

<p>On his arrival in London in September 1804, Park
presented a written statement to the Colonial Office
embodying his views as to the commercial and geographical
results likely to accrue from the intended
expedition, at the same time pointing out the best
means to accomplish the work as regards men and goods.
In this memorandum he pointed out the course he
proposed to pursue. Passing through Bondu, Kajaaga,
Fuladu, and Bambarra to Sego, he would construct a
boat and proceed by way of Jenné and Kabara (the port
of Timbuktu) through the kingdoms of Haussa, Nyffé
(now called Nupé), and Kashna, &amp;c., to the kingdom of
Wangara. If the river ended here, he pointed out,
his chief difficulty would begin. To return by the
Niger, to cross the desert to Tripoli or Egypt, or to
pass eastward to the Nile and Abyssinia, he considered
equally difficult. The most feasible course seemed that
towards the Bight of Benin. If, however, the Niger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
was, as he confidently believed, in reality the Congo,
he would follow it to its termination. After pointing
out the grounds for his belief, Park concluded with the
opinion that when “your Lordship shall have duly
weighed the above reasons, you will be induced to conclude
that my hopes of returning by the Congo are not
altogether fanciful, and that the expedition, though
attended with extreme danger, promises to be productive
of the utmost advantage to Great Britain.
Considered in a commercial point of view, it is second
only to the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope, and
in a geographical point of view is certainly the greatest
discovery that remains to be made in the world”&mdash;a
very strong statement of the case, it must be admitted,
though undoubtedly if the Niger and the Congo had
proved to be one, it could scarcely have been said to
be too strong.</p>

<p>Park had been converted to this view of the identity
of the two great rivers by one George Maxwell, a West
African trader, who had seen much of the Congo near
its mouth, and had published a chart embodying the
results of his observations. When closely examined, the
arguments in its favour were of small value, and practically
arose out of the fact that there was a large river
with a southerly trend whose termination was unknown,
while further south there was a second, the Congo,
whose origin was equally a mystery. Prolong these in
the necessary direction and the result is identity, and
the mystery of both is settled.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Major Rennell stuck to his view with all
the pertinacity of the arm-chair geographer, and the
man of one idea. For him the Niger ended in the
desert wastes of Wangara and Ghana. Unfortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
for his theory the Major was unconsciously confounding
two Wangaras separated from each other by fifteen
hundred miles and more, and likewise the old Empire of
Ghana on the middle course of the Niger with Kano at
the eastern extremity of the Haussa States. A similar
confusion also appears in Park’s memorandum, where
he speaks of the continuation of the river after Nupé to
Kashna (Katsina) and the kingdom of Wangara.</p>

<p>Strange indeed it seems to us now that no geographer
even at this time ever suggested that the outlet of
the Niger might be in the Bight of Benin, among the
numerous creeks that penetrate the low swampy mangrove
ground which here subtends the Bight. Looking
at the map, the suggestion seems to us to come naturally,
yet Park had to carry the course of the river away
south to the Congo; Rennell turned it west, and ended
it where our maps are now occupied by Lake Chad,
while there were not wanting others, like Jackson, who
persisted in joining it to the Nile, “en abusant, pour
ainsi dire, du vaste carrière que l’intérieur de l’Afrique
y laissait prendre,” as D’Anville had said of earlier
geographers.</p>

<p>Whatever we may now think of Park’s theories as to
the termination of the Niger, they did not appear in
any way absurd in his own time. The wildest conjecture
was permissible as regards a vast river flowing
by an uncertain course through a continent still blank
on our maps. Accordingly his memorandum was received
favourably by Lord Camden, and the despatch
of the expedition to carry out the traveller’s ideas was
determined on.</p>

<p>A liberal compensation was to be given to Park on
his return, and it was also stipulated that in the event<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
of his death, or of his not being heard of within a given
period, a certain sum should be paid by Government as
a provision for his wife and family.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rennell, in the most friendly fashion, not
only argued against Park’s views as to the Niger termination,
but earnestly advised him to relinquish his dangerous
project. With as little effect in the one case as
in the other, however. The explorer’s determination,
like his opinions, was not to be shaken. Sir Joseph
Banks took up a more philosophic position. He admitted
the hazardous nature of the enterprise; but
since the work was not to be accomplished without
risk of life, he could not attempt to dissuade Park from
it, he being the man most likely to carry it through
with least danger of a fatal issue.</p>

<p>Gradually the affairs of the expedition began to take
shape. Dr. Alexander Anderson, Park’s young brother-in-law,
was selected as his second in command, and Mr.
George Scott, a fellow-dalesman, was added to the party
as draughtsman. A few boat-builders and artificers were
also to accompany the party from England, for the purpose
of constructing the boat intended for the navigation
of the Niger when it was reached. Soldiers to
assist and protect the expedition were to be selected
at Goree, where a garrison of the African corps was
stationed.</p>

<p>It was now a matter of paramount importance that
the expedition should leave England at once if it was
to take advantage of the dry season. But official
red-tape was as difficult to galvanise into activity and
life as African apathy, and in spite of his utmost
endeavours to push matters on, delay succeeded upon
delay, and Park saw the good season gradually dwindling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
away, leaving him to the maddening contemplation of
all the additional difficulties and dangers engendered by
the rains. Two whole months were thus lost; and when
he at last received his official instructions, he knew that
the Government, by its continued procrastination, had
done much if not everything to ensure a disastrous
termination to the expedition.</p>

<p>In the instructions supplied to him Park’s mission
was defined as being to discover whether and to what
extent commercial intercourse could be established in
the interior of Africa for the mutual benefit of the
natives and of His Majesty’s subjects. He was directed
to proceed up the Gambia, and thence to the banks of
the Niger by way of the Senegal. The special object of
his journey was to determine the course of the Niger,
and to establish communication with all the different
nations on its banks. He was at liberty to pursue
any return route which he might find most suitable,
either by turning west to the Atlantic, or by marching
upon Cairo.</p>

<p>To carry out this great mission effectively, a captain’s
commission was bestowed on him, and that of a lieutenant
on Anderson. European soldiers to the number
of forty-five, and as many natives as he might deem
necessary, were to be selected at Goree, and a sufficient
number of donkeys at St. Jago. He was further
empowered to draw for any sum he might want not
exceeding £5000.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>PARK’S SECOND RETURN TO THE GAMBIA.</i></span></h2>

<p>On the 31st January 1805, Park, with his companions
and four or five artificers, sailed from Portsmouth in the
<i>Crescent</i> transport for St. Jago, Cape Verde Islands.</p>

<p>In crossing the Bay of Biscay they were considerably
detained by storms and contrary winds, so that it took
five weeks to reach their primary destination. From
St. Jago, where forty-four donkeys were purchased, they
proceeded to Goree, arriving at that station on the 21st
of March. Here the idea of an expedition to the Niger
was received with such enthusiasm by officers and men
alike that the entire garrison was ready to join&mdash;the
officers for the adventure and honour of the thing, the
men for the increased pay and promised discharge on
their return.</p>

<p>One officer, Lieutenant Martyn, was selected, and
with him thirty-five privates and two seamen.</p>

<p>Park’s idea of taking with him a considerable number
of European artisans and soldiers must be considered
one of the greatest blunders he ever made. A moment’s
thought should surely have told him that he ran a
terrible risk of speedily losing the greater number by
death, and that through sickness the majority of those
who kept alive would be more a hindrance than a help
to him. He should have known that these ignorant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
men were not as he himself seemed to be&mdash;rendered disease
and privation proof by the determination to achieve
a certain great object. Against all forms of death, save
death by violence, his <i>will</i> was to him a magic mail.
With his men it was different. Ignorant of what was
before them&mdash;incapable of comprehending it even had
it been told&mdash;they only saw in the enterprise a certain
freedom from irksome garrison restrictions and military
discipline, increased pay, and the prospect of early discharge.
To all else they were blind.</p>

<p>Brought face to face with hourly dangers, privations,
and incessant toil, they quickly realised their mistake.
Everything was forgotten save the present physical
suffering. Sick and dispirited, what was the question
of the Niger’s course to them? A mere name, without
power to fire their imagination or inspire their enthusiasm.
How insignificant, too, appeared the material
recompense. Thus with nothing to buoy them up,
nothing to lure them on and keep them from magnifying
and dwelling on their troubles, there could be
nothing but apathy&mdash;with apathy, despondency, and
finally death. This has been the history, more or less,
of nearly all African expeditions in which ignorant
European men have been employed, tempted to join
merely for pay or other considerations of a personal
character. In proportion as the members of an expedition
have been inspired by its ultimate objects, they
have lived to see it through, because in that proportion
they have given less attention to their hardships and
sicknesses. The less they have thought of themselves,
and the more their minds have been centred on their
work, the better have been their chances of pulling
through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>But though all the whites of the Goree garrison were
willing to accompany Park, not one of the negroes of
the place could be induced to join, and he therefore had
to depend on getting such natives as he wanted on the
Gambia. He left Goree on the 6th of April, and reached
Kayi, on the Gambia, a few days later.</p>

<p>The prospect now before him was anything but pleasant.
The rainy season, which he had such good grounds
to fear, was rapidly approaching. There were but two
alternatives&mdash;either to wait till the next dry season
before starting, or go on and face the worst&mdash;the fevers,
the rains, the marshes, the flooded rivers, and all the
other accompaniments of the wet season. These must
undoubtedly produce much sickness, probably many
deaths, innumerable exasperating delays, and other
troubles&mdash;must increase, in fact, by a hundredfold the
perils and trials of the expedition. On the other hand,
to wait would mean a delay of seven months&mdash;seven
months of inaction, of intolerable fretting at the very
threshold of the enterprise. The idea was out of the
question. Besides, men, animals, and goods were ready
for the road, and the Government expected them to
proceed forthwith. A delay of the kind had not been
foreseen, and had not been provided for in Park’s instructions.
Of the two evils, therefore, he chose the one
which was most in harmony with his own eager spirit,
determining to risk all and start forthwith. Having
once made up his mind, he put aside all fears and apprehensions,
and would allow nothing to damp his sanguine
hopes. In this spirit he wrote to Dickson:&mdash;“Everything
at present looks as favourable as I could wish,
and if all things go well this day six weeks I expect to
drink all your healths in the water of the Niger. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
soldiers are in good health and spirits. They are the
most <i>dashing</i> men I ever saw, and if they preserve their
health we may keep ourselves perfectly secure from any
hostile attempt on the part of the natives. I have little
doubt but that I shall be able, with presents and fair
words, to pass through the country to the Niger, and if
once we are afloat the day is won.”</p>

<p>We can easily believe that Park in this letter does
not give a faithful indication of his real position at the
moment of writing. He may have expressed his hopes
truly enough, but he carefully avoids showing the fears
which went side by side with them. What exact significance
the term “dashing,” as applied to his soldiers,
bears in relation to their qualities as members of an
African expedition, might be a matter of discussion;
but while we have every reason to believe they were
the best the garrison could supply, it must also be
remembered that the African corps was the residuum
of the British army at a time when it was the chief
resort of the rascaldom of the country. A residence,
however short, in a West African garrison, could have
improved neither their physique, their morals, nor their
discipline, and certainly was not calculated to fit them
for one of the most dangerous and trying enterprises
any man could enter upon, and requiring moral and
physical qualities which only the very few possess.</p>

<p>To his error in taking with him such a large party of
Europeans, Park added an even worse mistake, and one
for which less excuse can be found. Nowhere in his
diary do we find a single reference to his having any
native followers to do the common drudgery of the
camp and the road. This was a want of foresight
which appears almost incredible in one who knew what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
was before him, and the results which followed when
all the men fell sick were disastrous beyond description.</p>

<p>Thus, then, to the extreme perils and hardships
which attend an African expedition at all times, Park
added a start at the worst possible time of the year,
and with the worst possible selection of men. What
came of it the following pages will show.</p>

<p>On the 27th of April 1805, all was ready for the
march. The initial point was Kayi, on the river
Gambia, a few miles below Pisania, the place from
which Park started on his first expedition. How
different were his preparations for this new attempt.
In the former he had left for the interior attended by
a man and a boy&mdash;a single donkey carrying all the goods
and stores he required. This time he was provided with
forty-four Europeans, and a large quantity of baggage
of all kinds, transported by as many donkeys as there
were men. As already said, we find no allusion in his
letters or journals to his having any native attendants,
though possibly there might have been one or two
as personal servants. Isaaco, a Mandingo priest and
merchant, had been engaged to act as guide, and he it
seems was accompanied by several of his own people.</p>

<p>Under cover of a salute from the <i>Crescent</i> and other
vessels gathered on the river, the caravan filed out of
Kayi, and took the road for the interior&mdash;each man,
according to his temperament, aspirations, and education,
filled with varied emotions of hope and fear, at
once attracted and repelled by the vague unknown
which lay before him.</p>

<p>The troubles and worries attendant on leading a large
caravan in Africa became only too soon apparent. The
day was extremely hot. Under the influence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
overpowering temperature the overloaded donkeys lay
down and refused to proceed, while others, resenting
the imposition of any burden, did what they could to
kick themselves free, thus giving an infinite amount of
trouble to their drivers.</p>

<p>The men themselves, fresh from the relaxing life and
coarse debaucheries of a West African garrison, soon
began to give in as well as their donkeys, so that before
long the caravan, from being a continuous line, was
broken into detached groups and isolated individuals
resting here, struggling on there. Finally the party
got completely divided, some under Lieutenant Martyn
taking one way, and the rest with Park another. Towards
evening they again became united, and reached
a suitable camping ground thoroughly fatigued by their
first march. Next day Pisania was reached, and here
a halt became necessary to make some final preparations
and purchase eight more donkeys.</p>

<p>On the 4th of May the journey was resumed. The
caravan was divided into six messes, each with its due
proportion of animals marked for easy identification.
Scott and one of Isaaco’s men led the way, Martyn took
charge of the centre body, while Anderson and Park
brought up the rear. Even with the additional beasts
of burden there was a repetition of the troubles which
marked the first march&mdash;troubles which became each
day more harassing with the failing strength of the
donkeys and the sickness which after a time developed
among their drivers. The leaders were each provided
with horses for riding, but in a very short time they
had to take to their feet, that their animals might be
utilised for the transport of loads belonging to broken-down
donkeys. A few days more and this likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
proved insufficient, and both new donkeys and new
drivers had to be hired.</p>

<p>By the fourth day from Pisania two soldiers were
attacked by dysentery, and a further addition to the
strength of the caravan was found necessary. In a
week the expedition reached Medina, the capital of
Wuli, without special mishap, but with ever growing
worries for its leader.</p>

<p>The keen eye to business so characteristic of negro
races was well shown by the women of Bambaku, who,
on hearing of the coming of the white men, drew all
the water out of the wells in the hope of forcing the
strangers to buy it at a high price in beads and other
gauds dear to the negro heart. In this, however, they
were outwitted by the soldiers, and they had the inexpressible
mortification of seeing twenty-four hours’
labour utterly lost, and the beads as unattainable as
ever.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the report of the passage of a rich caravan
conducted by many Europeans spread like wildfire,
gaining in exaggeration with every mile, and
putting all the robber bands and chiefs on the alert.
Preceded by such rumours it became necessary to
travel with great circumspection, and in constant
readiness for an attack. No one was allowed to lay
aside his gun. By way of invoking the aid of a
higher power than that of man, Isaaco, on entering
the reputedly dangerous woods of Simbani, laid a black
ram across the road, and after reciting a long prayer,
cut its throat as a sacrifice. These woods were alive
with hundreds of antelopes. The Gambia, where it
traversed them, was a hundred yards wide, and showed
a perceptible tide. On the sands were great numbers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
alligators, while the pools teemed with hippos. Viewed
from an eminence, the country towards the west appeared
abundantly rich and enchanting, the course of the
Gambia being traceable by its fringing lines of dark
green trees winding in serpentine curves seaward.</p>

<p>At a place called Faraba, while unloading the animals
preparatory to camping, one of the soldiers fell down in
an epileptic fit, and expired in an hour. Here water
was only to be got by digging. During the night, as
they were in the wilderness, and liable to attack, double
sentries were posted round the camp, and every man
slept with his loaded musket beside him.</p>

<p>Next morning the Neaulico stream, then nearly dry,
was passed, and on that and a succeeding night they
camped in the woods, the second occasion being at the
river Nerico.</p>

<p>On the 18th the caravan entered Jallacotta, the first
town of Tenda.</p>

<p>Two days later they met with an insolent reception
from the chief of the independent village of Bady, who
refused the caravan-tax sent him, and threatened war if
his exorbitant demands were not satisfied. Park tried
personally to arrange the dispute, but only met with
threats. The soldiers were at once ordered to be in
readiness for whatever might happen, while the chief
was told that nothing more would be given him, and
that if he would not allow their peaceable passage through
his district, another would be found. After many angry
words Park prepared to carry his resolution into effect,
but before the necessary preparations were completed,
Isaaco’s horse was seized by the Bady people. On the
owner going to demand its restitution, he himself was
laid hold of, deprived of his gun and sword, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
tied to a tree and flogged. At the same time his boy
was put in irons.</p>

<p>It was now dark, but prompt action was necessary.
Accordingly Park, with a detachment of soldiers, entered
the village to seize the robbers of the horse, intending
to hold them as hostages for the safe delivery of the
guide. This attempt naturally led to much uproar,
ending finally in blows, and the driving of all the chief’s
people out of the village. Isaaco, however, was nowhere
to be found, and Park was somewhat puzzled to
know what to do. It would of course have been easy
to burn down the village, but this would have entailed
death and ruin on many innocent persons, possibly
without producing the desired effect. Under the circumstances
it was deemed advisable to wait till daylight
before making an attack. This course proved to be
both wise and humane, for in the morning Isaaco was
liberated and his horse restored, so that eventually all
ended amicably.</p>

<p>On the 24th of May much lightning was seen to the
south-east&mdash;ominous premonition of the approaching
rains. Of the party Park and Isaaco alone could realise
what those electric flashes betokened to the fortunes of
the expedition.</p>

<p>Their way for the next three days lay through the
Tenda Wilderness&mdash;with all the hard marches, short
rations, and scant supplies of water which an uninhabited
district at the end of the dry season implies,
and which were hardly to be compensated by the exceeding
picturesqueness of the scenery.</p>

<p>At the second camp in the wilderness an extraordinary
mishap befell them. A hive of bees was disturbed
by one of the men, with the result that they swarmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
out in angry myriads to attack the intruders. They set
upon man and beast alike, and in a twinkling had routed
every two-legged and four-footed thing in the camp.
The men threw down weapons&mdash;everything&mdash;and fled in
dismay, along with frantic braying donkeys. The horses
similarly broke loose, and galloped to the woods in a
panic. Meanwhile the fires which had been kindled,
being thus left unattended, speedily began to spread
to the surrounding dry grass and bamboos. When
Park and his companions had time to look round,
they discovered to their dismay that the whole camp
was on fire, and menaced by absolute and irretrievable
ruin.</p>

<p>Forgetful of all else before such an appalling danger
to the expedition, those who had suffered least from the
furious bees rushed back to save what they could.
Happily not too late. Before the goods were reached
by the fire, Park and some of the men were ready to
receive the enemy, and eventually succeeded in extinguishing
it.</p>

<p>The impending conflagration over, the horses and
donkeys were with difficulty collected from the woods,
many of them terribly stung and swollen about the head.
Three animals, besides Isaaco’s horse, disappeared altogether.
One donkey died that evening, another next
morning, and a third had to be abandoned, so vicious
and deadly had been the bees’ onslaught.</p>

<p>Many curious superstitions were noticed by Park <i>en
route</i> through Wuli and Tenda. At one place death
was believed to be the portion of any one who slept
under a particular tree; at another, the fish in the
river must not be caught, else the water would dry
up entirely; while at a third, any traveller who would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
assure himself of a safe journey, must lift and turn
round a particular stone.</p>

<p>At Julifunda the chief made exorbitant demands on
the caravan, threatening to attack them in the woods if
these were not complied with. Park’s resolute attitude,
however, combined with an addition to his first present,
brought the quarrel to an amicable conclusion, and he
was permitted to continue his route unmolested.</p>

<p>The expedition had now reached the eastern confines
of the Gambia basin, and writing home to his wife, Park
reviewed his situation as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“We are half through our journey (<i>i.e.</i> to the Niger)
without the smallest accident or unpleasant circumstance.
We all of us keep our health, and are on the most
friendly terms with the natives.... By the 27th of
June we expect to have finished all our travels by land,
and when we have once got afloat on the river, we shall
conclude that we are embarking for England. I have
never had the smallest sickness, and Alexander (Mrs.
Park’s brother) is quite free from all his complaints....
We carry our own victuals with us, and live very well&mdash;in
fact we have only had a very pleasant journey; and yet
this is what we thought would be the worst part of it.”</p>

<p>In looking back undoubtedly Park had every reason
to be satisfied with his journey so far. His men seemed
to have worked heartily enough&mdash;at least we find no indications
in his journal of insubordination, grumbling,
or bad conduct. But then he never was in the habit of
putting the least stress on his troubles. It was of more
importance to him to be able to say that he had advanced
a day’s march nearer the Niger than that he had been
subjected to a week’s maddening worry. All vexations
and discomforts he treated like the suppressed adven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>tures
of his former narrative, of which he said that as
they were only of importance to himself, he would not
weary the reader with a recital of them.</p>

<div class="center">
<img id="i_229" src="images/i_229.png" width="600" height="404" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MUNGO PARK’S ENCAMPMENT.</p></div>

<p>It is only too probable that he had much trouble with
his men, and certainly between the lines we gather that
he had an immense amount of work to perform&mdash;looking
after his caravan on the road, buying food, and holding
innumerable palavers, &amp;c., in camp. Even the nights
he could not call his own, for observations for latitude
and longitude must be taken at all hours&mdash;notes written
out, and the observations calculated. He had to be
at once overseer, buyer of food, interpreter, surveyor,
doctor, and general inspirer of the whole party. But
he was equal to everything that could be put on his
shoulders. Within him he had a sustaining force such
as was known to none of those about him, and which
gave him a giant’s strength and the spirit of the gods.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>STILL STRUGGLING TOWARDS THE GREAT RIVER.</i></span></h2>

<p>Park in his letter home was careful only to look
backward: it is now our business to accompany him
forward, and see what happened as he passed across the
Senegal basin on his way to the Niger.</p>

<p>On the 7th of June he crossed the Samaku, which
flows north to join the Falemé, and in fear of an attack,
travelled rapidly through an uninhabited district by a
forced march. Here two of the donkeys had to be
abandoned, and there being no guiding pathway, as
darkness came on, muskets were frequently fired to
prevent the men losing each other.</p>

<p>Early next day the Falemé was seen in the distance.
The carpenter, who had become very ill, could not sit
upright on a donkey, and time after time threw himself
off, declaring that he would rather die. Latterly it took
two men to hold him in his seat by force, and at the
Falemé, which was crossed in the course of the day, he
had to be left behind in charge of a soldier. He died a
few hours after.</p>

<p>That night a heavy tornado burst upon the caravan.
Five soldiers who had not been under proper shelter,
and got a wetting, became ill in consequence.</p>

<p>It could no longer be ignored that the rains were at last
upon them, and that just when they were in the network<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
of streams into which the Senegal and the Niger divide
in their uppermost reaches. One terrible necessity of
their situation was, that sick or not sick, there could be
no halting to allow of possible recovery. They must
push forward towards their goal, though the route
should be marked by the dead bodies of their comrades.
The longer the delay, the more difficult would the march
become, from flooded rivers, more incessant rains, and
the increasing swampiness of the country.</p>

<p>Up to this time Park had followed his former return
route. He now determined to strike a line further
north in order to avoid the Jallonka Wilderness, of
whose horrors he had such a lively recollection. The
new route was hard and rocky, and very fatiguing to
the donkeys. As the day went on many of the sick
became hopelessly unfit to drive their animals. One of
them Park mounted on his own horse while he himself
assumed the part of donkey driver. Even then four of
the donkeys had to be left in the woods, and he himself
did not reach camp till long after dark. Before
the tents could be pitched a tornado came down upon
them and drenched them to the skin. The ground was
speedily covered to a depth of three inches, and in this
uncomfortable plight&mdash;fireless, tentless, dripping&mdash;they
had to pass the night. A second tornado about two in
the morning completed their discomfiture.</p>

<p>This night, in Park’s own words, was “the beginning
of sorrows.... Now that the rain had set in, I trembled
to think that we were only half way through our
journey. The rain had not commenced three minutes
before many of the soldiers were affected with vomiting,
others fell asleep, and seemed as if half intoxicated. I
felt a strong inclination to sleep during the storm, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
as soon as it was over I fell asleep on the wet ground,
although I used every exertion to keep myself awake.
The soldiers likewise fell asleep on the wet bundles.”</p>

<p>The immediate result of that night was the addition
of twelve men to the sick list. Next day all the horses
and spare donkeys were requisitioned to carry such as
were unable to walk. The road proved to be a difficult
one along the base of the Konkadu mountains, whose
precipices overhung the line of march in threatening
masses.</p>

<p>Barely had camp been reached when once more a
tornado burst in all its fury, but thanks to the proximity
of a village, with less disastrous results than on the previous
evening.</p>

<p>The storm past, Park proceeded to examine some
gold diggings; after which, accompanied by Scott, he
set off to the top of the Konkadu hills, finding them
cultivated to the highest elevations. There also he
found villages romantically situated in delightful glens,
with water and grass in abundance throughout the
year; and there, “while the thunder rolls in awful
grandeur over their heads, they can look from their
tremendous precipices over all that wild and woody
plain which extends from the Falemé to the Bafing or
Black River.”</p>

<p>To struggle forward handicapped with incapable men
and driverless donkeys was now hard work. Half the
caravan were sick, or too weak to exert themselves
with effect. The result was never-ending confusion and
delay. Unable to hold together, men and donkeys alike
went astray, keeping Park, who could not be in a dozen
places at once, in a state of continual watchfulness and
motion, doing his best to bring up the incapables, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
“coaxing” them to further exertions each time they
insisted on lying down, indifferent alike to robbers, lions,
or the fevers of night.</p>

<p>In spite of his iron constitution and sanguine heroic
spirit Park himself was not altogether invulnerable,
and he too became fevered at times&mdash;only, however,
to show himself superior to suffering by virtue of his
marvellous will and the exigencies of his situation.
Conscious that the whole fate of the expedition depended
upon his keeping well, he dared not give way. He was
a second self to every one&mdash;without him all were absolutely
helpless.</p>

<p>On leaving Fankia on the 15th of June, most of the
men were ill, some of them even delirious. In this condition
the caravan had to commence the ascent of the
Tambaura mountains. The road was excessively steep&mdash;the
donkeys terribly overloaded under their double
burden of sick men and goods. Owing to the nature of
the ground, each animal would have required at least
one separate driver to guide and assist, but in the
present case this was impossible. The result was a scene
of dreadful confusion and disaster. Loaded donkeys
were constantly tumbling over the rocks or falling
exhausted on the pathway, while sick men, indifferent
to their fate, threw themselves down, declaring they
could go no further. The natives, discovering the
predicament of the caravan, crept down among the
rocks and stole what they could when a favourable
opportunity offered.</p>

<p>At length, by means of superhuman exertions, Park
succeeded in bringing all safely out of the perilous pass
to a village, where he had the inexpressible pleasure
of meeting the Mohammedan schoolmaster who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
been so kind to him at Kamalia, and while travelling
with Karfa. As an earnest of his gratitude for past
favours, Park gave him a handsome present of cloth,
beads, and amber, with which the good old man was
delighted. The God-fearing Scotchman did not neglect
to add an Arabic New Testament to his other gifts.</p>

<p>The history of the expedition was now one of growing
trouble, sickness, and disorganisation. Tornadoes
were almost of daily occurrence, and the country and
the streams became more and more difficult to traverse.</p>

<p>Up to the 17th of June two men had died, and on
that date two more were left behind at the point of
death. The three days following Park himself was
sick, as were now more than half his men, though
still they struggled on. To add to the dangers of their
situation, they were utterly unable to keep proper watch
over their goods either by day or night&mdash;a fact the
natives speedily learned, and constantly dogged their
footsteps, intent on plunder.</p>

<p>At one village the inhabitants turned out <i>en masse</i>,
prepared to find the white man’s caravan so reduced by
sickness as to fall an easy prize. As a preliminary to
further depredations one of the villagers seized the
bridle of the sergeant’s horse and tried to lead it and
its apparently helpless owner inside the village walls.
The presentation of the rider’s pistol made him think
better of it. At the same time others made as if they
would drive away the donkeys. They had reckoned
without their host, however. Galvanised into new life,
the soldiers promptly loaded their muskets and fixed
their bayonets, at sight of which warlike preparations
the natives were not slow to quit their prey and retire
to a safer distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p><div class="center">
<img id="i_235" src="images/i_235.png" width="600" height="403" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ROCK SCENERY OF THE UPPER SENEGAL.</p></div>

<p>Having driven their animals across a torrent, the
soldiers left certain of their number to guard them,
and returned to the village, ready to give its inhabitants
a lesson in courtesy and hospitality. At this
moment Park arrived on the scene. Ever anxious to
avoid bloodshed, he called a palaver, and speedily convinced
the chief how insane it would be for him or his
people to molest him. At the same time, desirous of
leaving a favourable impression behind, in case any sick
men might have to repass this way, Park gave the chief
a present, with the remark that it was to show he did
not come to make war, though if he were attacked he
would fight to the last.</p>

<p>Beyond this point the country became picturesque
beyond words, resembling in its physical features all
sorts of architectural forms, ruined castles, spires, pyramids.
One rocky hill looked so like a ruined Gothic
abbey that the whole party had to approach close to it
to satisfy themselves that its various features were not
really what they seemed. Beyond this <i>lusus naturæ</i> a
compact mass of red granite stood up bare and gaunt,
absolutely destitute of a relieving blade of grass. Here
and there were villages clustering in the curved niches
of giant precipices, alike secured from tropic blasts and
the devastating attacks of men. Everything was rugged
and grand&mdash;the sterner features only enhanced by the
interchange of beautiful fertile hollows and silvery
streams winding through the green fields and darker
forest tracts.</p>

<p>Similar scenes characterised the whole journey through
Konkadu, and the caravan at length reached the borders
of Wuladu at the Bafing. The crossing of this river in
small rickety canoes was not accomplished without a sad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
fatality, one of them capsizing with three soldiers, of
whom one was drowned.</p>

<p>The people of Wuladu had a notorious reputation as
thieves, the justice of which was speedily illustrated by
their various more or less successful attempts to lift
from the strangers whatever they saw, thus keeping
the latter continually on the alert.</p>

<p>After crossing the Bafing, many of the sick who had
struggled on bravely so far began to lose all spirit. An
unconquerable lassitude at times seized them, and no
matter what the danger of the situation, their only
desire was to lie down and be left to die. To escape
the cajolery and coercion to which they were subjected,
they frequently left the track, and gave their leader no
end of worry and trouble hunting them up after camp
was reached. In this way several men disappeared
altogether, bringing up the total losses on the 29th
June to nine.</p>

<p>Besides its human cormorants, Wuladu proved to be
infested with various beasts of prey, whereby further
anxiety and watchfulness were entailed on the harassed
and despondent little band, weak, and growing every
day weaker.</p>

<p>Anderson and Scott, on whom Park so much depended
to encourage and push on his followers, besides
themselves doing the work of three or four, now became
incapacitated, while as far as we can gather
from the journal, Lieutenant Martyn never seems to
have been of any use. Everything, accordingly, devolved
on the leader himself, who, ailing as he was,
had to put forth superhuman exertions&mdash;driving refractory
and exhausted donkeys, lifting the fallen, and reloading
such as had kicked off or dropped their burdens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>&mdash;at
every step spurring on the sick and despondent to
strive towards their destination, and not allow themselves
to be murdered by natives, devoured by wild
beasts, or overcome by the deadly malaria of the
jungles. In camp he had as little rest as on the road.
No one else was fit to do anything&mdash;or being fit, was
not willing&mdash;so that he had to be man-of-all-work to
nearly forty men. The night brought neither oblivion
nor relaxation&mdash;only new anxieties and new duties.
Sleep he could only get in short snatches&mdash;between
whiles taking his astronomical observations, and making
the round of the camp to stir up indifferent and sickly
sentinels. Not unfrequently he had to mount guard
himself throughout the whole night to save the donkeys
from being killed or stampeded by the wild beasts which
kept constantly prowling about. The stormier the night,
the greater necessity was there for him to be up and
doing, no matter what the cost to himself personally.</p>

<p>On the 4th of July the Furkomo River, another important
tributary of the Senegal, was reached. The
number of deaths now amounted to eleven, most of them
having occurred within the last fortnight.</p>

<p>In crossing the Furkomo or Bakhoy, Isaaco had a
narrow escape from a crocodile. When near the middle
of the river, he was seized by the left thigh and pulled
under water. With wonderful presence of mind he
thrust his finger into the reptile’s eye, with the result
that it let go its hold. Ere he could regain the shore,
however, the crocodile returned to the attack, and seized
him by the other thigh. Again he thrust his finger into
its eye, with a similar happy result, and before it could
come at him again, bleeding and lacerated, he reached
land. That night, though it threatened rain, every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
was so sick and exhausted&mdash;even Park being unable to
stand upright&mdash;that it was only with the utmost difficulty
that the tents were put up and the loads placed
inside. Isaaco’s wounds made travelling impossible for
him, and as the caravan was largely dependent on his
services, a three days’ halt was decided on.</p>

<p>With the guide’s partial recovery the march was continued
to Keminum, the neighbourhood of which they
reached with apprehension. The town was fortified in
a remarkably strong fashion. There was first a ditch
8 feet deep, backed by a wall as many feet high. Inside
was a second wall 10 feet in height, within which was a
third of 16 feet.</p>

<p>The chief and his thirty sons were neither more nor
less than an organised band of robbers who terrorised
over the whole district. Ample evidence of the manner
of his rule was afforded by the heap of human bones
outside the walls, where he executed such prisoners as
were not made slaves of. During the night all the
energies of the caravan were employed in seeking to
protect themselves from the incessant attempts of the
natives to steal; but so helpless were most of the men
that they allowed themselves to be deprived of great-coats,
muskets, pistols, almost without resistance.</p>

<p>The morning brought no reprieve. The chief’s sons,
not satisfied with their share of the present and the
plunder, did their best to secure some valuable souvenirs
of the white man. This one of them first tried to do
wholesale by simply lifting a load from a donkey, but
the culprit was chased and had to drop his plunder.
The confusion produced by this incident gave another
thief a chance to bolt with a musket.</p>

<p>Innumerable exasperating attempts of a similar nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
kept Park in constant alarm lest some of the soldiers
should use their weapons and precipitate a fight.
Accordingly, his chief anxiety became to get away as
quickly as possible. Riding a little way out of the
village to see the nature of the road ahead, one of the
chief’s sons distracted his attention while he halted,
whereupon the other suddenly snatched away the traveller’s
loosely held musket. At once Park gave chase
with brandished sword. Anderson, seeing what had
occurred, rushed to his assistance with upraised gun;
but observing who was the offender, he hesitated to fire,
with the result that the thief escaped safely to the rocks.
Meanwhile the brother had leisurely helped himself to
whatever loose property he found on Park’s horse.</p>

<p>Orders were now given to shoot the first person found
stealing. But the princes were not easily frightened,
and during a tornado that burst overhead, one of them
got off with a musket and a couple of pistols. An
attempt was next made to drive off the donkeys, but fortunately
was frustrated. By way of example, a native
detected in stealing was promptly fired at. On the
march being resumed, every foot of the road was dogged
by the plundering wretches, who scented their prey in
every man who lagged behind, and every donkey that
fell or strayed from the path.</p>

<p>It was dark before a camping place was reached, and
the night was passed in much misery, man and beast
lying on the wet ground without shelter, exposed to the
excessively heavy dews.</p>

<p>The march through Wuladu was simply a daily
repetition of the experiences at Keminum. Thieves
hung on the skirts of the caravan like hyenas on the
track of blood, never quitting them by night or by day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
All stragglers, human or animal, they made their prey,
and by their attempted depredations kept the unhappy
travellers in constant alarm. Each morning and evening
had its tale of loss. Everything, however, was
tolerated, that bloodshed might be avoided&mdash;a forbearance
only looked upon as weakness and cowardice
by the natives, who were encouraged accordingly to
continue their marauding with increased audacity.
Park was at length driven to stronger measures, and
on one occasion pursued a robber on horseback, and
after hunting him down, shot him through the leg.
This example had a most salutary effect for a time,
though that day’s tale of spoliation alone included the
more or less complete stripping of four sick men, and
a donkey loaded with the muskets, &amp;c., of the other
invalids.</p>

<p>Let us quote a characteristic day’s proceedings from
Park’s own journal:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<i>July 19th.</i>&mdash;Having purchased an ass in lieu of the
one stolen, we left Nummabu, which is a walled village,
and proceeded onwards. Had two tornadoes. The last,
about eleven o’clock, wetted us much, and made the road
slippery. Two asses unable to go on. Put their loads
on the horses and left them. Mr. Scott’s horse unable
to walk. Left it to our guide. At noon came to the
ruins of a town. Found two more of the asses unable
to carry their loads. Hired people to carry the loads,
and a boy to drive the asses. Passed the ruins of
another town at half-past twelve, where I found two of
the sick who had laid themselves down under a tree and
refused to rise. They were afterwards stripped by the
negroes, and came naked to our tents next morning.
Shortly after this came to an ass lying on the road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
unable to proceed with its load. Put part of the load
on my horse, which was already heavily loaded. Took
a knapsack on my back. The soldier carried the remainder,
and drove the ass before him. We arrived
at the Ba Winbina at half-past one o’clock.” Here
follows a description of how a bridge was built, which,
though instructive in the extreme, is too long for insertion.
“Our people being all sickly, I hired the
negroes to carry over all the baggage, and swim over
the asses. Our baggage was laid on the rocks on the
east side of the river, but such was our weakly state
that we were unable to carry it up the bank. Francis
Beedle, one of the soldiers, was evidently dying of the
fever, and having in vain attempted, with the assistance
of one of his messmates, to carry him over, I was forced
to leave him on the west bank, thinking it very probable
that he would die in the course of the night.”</p>

<p>Day after day the same disheartening tale had to be
told. Now a man is found expiring, and no time can
be lost waiting for his death. Anon another left for
dead is galvanised into life by the appearance of wolves
ready to make a meal of him. On the 27th July one
man had to be left in camp at the point of death&mdash;four
more dropped down on the road and refused to
proceed, wishing only to die. Park himself was “very
sick and faint, having to drive my horse loaded with
rice and an ass with the pit saw. Came to an eminence
from which I had a view of some very distant mountains
to the east half south. The certainty that the
Niger washes the southern base of these mountains
made me forget my fever, and I thought of nothing
all the way but how to climb over their blue summits.”
But to his men the sight gave neither health nor in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>spiration,
and but for the fact that to go back was as
difficult as to push forward, they would speedily have
shown in what direction their desires tended.</p>

<p>What the inmost thoughts of the intrepid explorer
were at this time we would give much to know. In his
journal he nowhere lifts the veil. Throughout there is
only the bare statement of fact that to-day so-and-so has
died&mdash;yesterday such another had to be left to his fate:
here a donkey was plundered&mdash;there an astronomical
observation taken. The one thing that can touch his
feelings is the sight of the blue summits of distant hills
whose bases are washed by the waters of the Niger.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>TO THE NIGER.</i></span></h2>

<p>Writing home on the 29th of May, Park, calculating
from his rate of progress so far, predicted that he would
reach the Niger on the 27th of June. It was now the
27th of July, and he was still in the heart of Wuladu,
and quite a hundred miles in a straight line from
Bammaku, his primary destination.</p>

<p>Meanwhile every one of the donkeys he had originally
started with had died or been stolen, and great inroads had
been made on his stores in replacing them, not to speak
of the loss entailed by plunder and other unforeseen
causes. Twenty of his men had died or been murdered,
and all of them were more or less unfit for work.
Nevertheless his hopes were as unquenchable as ever,
and he buoyed himself up with the belief that if he
could reach the Niger with a certain proportion of his
caravan, the success of his mission would be assured, as
the rest of the wet season might be passed in comparative
comfort while making preparations for navigating
the river. Once launched on its broad bosom, there
would be no more transport difficulties, and but little
work for his men, so that everything might be expected
to end happily and successfully.</p>

<p>Looking forward thus hopefully, Park turned S.W.
from Bangassi, the chief town of Wuladu, and set his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
face towards Bammaku. But however sanguine he
might be, he could not improve the conditions of his
march. The rains were now at their very worst. They
fell no longer in passing tornadoes, but in an incessant
drenching downpour. Every stream was swollen to the
dimensions of a river&mdash;every plain became a lake or
swamp through which the luckless travellers had to slip
and plunge as best they might. The very pathways
developed into rushing torrents. Subjected to such
conditions of travel, disease demanded its daily quota
of victims, while reducing the strength of all to the
vanishing point. The men speedily became unable to
load their animals&mdash;could hardly even drive them along.
Nearly the whole work of the caravan fell upon its
indomitable leader, who even on the road would sometimes
have as many as thirteen fallen donkeys to raise
up and reload.</p>

<p>On the 7th of August matters became so bad that he
found it necessary to halt for two days&mdash;a delay which
to him was almost maddening.</p>

<p>At the Ba Wulima, Park found Anderson lying under
a bush apparently dying, and had to carry him over on
his back. To assist in the transport of loads, &amp;c., he
had to cross the river sixteen times, with the water
reaching to his waist. In spite of his exertions, however,
several soldiers with their donkeys had to be left
behind.</p>

<p>In two days four men had been lost&mdash;the slow agony
of death from fever being undoubtedly in each case
accelerated by the daggers of robber negroes or the fell
fangs of wolves and other wild beasts.</p>

<p>On the day after leaving the Ba Wulima, Park was
the only European able to do any work, and but for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
assistance of Isaaco and his men, the caravan would have
been compelled to remain in camp. The day’s march
was a trying one. Anderson seemed at the point of
death, and it was with difficulty that his brother-in-law
succeeded in holding him on a horse. Every hour
threatened to be his last, and only by frequent rests
could he be got forward in short stages. While thus
employed supporting and cheering his well-loved friend
on the way towards camp, Park was suddenly confounded
by coming face to face with three large lions
making rapidly towards them. Intent first of all on
saving Anderson, with splendid courage he ran forward
to meet them half way, and so as to reserve himself a
second chance if his musket should miss fire, he aimed
as soon as the lions were within easy shot, and fired at
the middle one of the three. This reception brought
the enemy to a standstill, and after seemingly taking
counsel of each other, they turned tail and bounded
away. One, however, quickly stopped, and turned round
as if meditating another attack, but thinking better of
it, again resumed its flight, and left the travellers to
continue their way, though not without the strongest
suspicions that they were still being tracked, and might
be pounced upon in the fast gathering darkness. Before
camp was reached the path taken by the caravan was lost,
and in the darkness Park and his companion wandered
into a gully, where the road became so dangerous that at
length they dared not move further from fear of being
killed by falling over a precipice. Accordingly they were
compelled to make the best of their position, and wait till
morning tentless and foodless. Fortunately they were
able to raise a fire, near which, while Anderson lay
wrapt in a cloak, Park kept watch all night, to drive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
off lions and wolves. In the morning it was discovered
that half the caravan had passed the night in scattered
parties in much the same manner as their leader.
Happily there were no casualties.</p>

<p>At a place called Dumbila, Park had the pleasure of
meeting his old friend and protector, Karfa Taura. Here
Anderson became too ill to be moved, Scott had disappeared,
and only one man was able to drive a donkey.
At night rain descended in drenching torrents, and the
men took refuge in the village, leaving their leader
alone to watch that the donkeys did not stray into the
neighbouring corn-fields, and to defend them and their
loads alike from the attacks of wild beasts and from the
bands of marauding natives. But no matter how heavy
the burdens, not a grumble escaped the hero who had
to bear them all&mdash;not a hint that he felt himself badly
treated by his men and their officers.</p>

<p>On the 19th of August, Park, with the helpless,
shattered remnant of his caravan, ascended the mountain
ridge which forms the watershed between the Senegal
and the Niger. Pushing on eagerly to the summit
of the hill, the toil and careworn traveller’s eyes were
gladdened by the spectacle of the “Niger rolling its
immense stream along the plain.”</p>

<p>“After the fatiguing march which we had just experienced,
the sight of this river was no doubt pleasant,
as it promised an end to, or at least an alleviation
of, our toils. But when I reflected that three-fourths
of the soldiers had died on the march, and that in
addition to our weakly state we had no carpenters to
build the boats in which we proposed to prosecute our
discoveries, the prospect appeared somewhat gloomy. It,
however, afforded me peculiar pleasure when I reflected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
that in conducting a party of Europeans with immense
baggage through an extent of more than five hundred
miles, I had always been able to preserve the most
friendly terms with the natives.”</p>

<p>The latter sentence is well worthy of note as illustrative
of Park’s methods of travel at a time when the
sanctity of human life, whether black or white, was not
quite so much thought of as at present.</p>

<p>In speaking of the distance traversed as five hundred
miles, it must be remembered that what is meant is the
distance in a straight line expressed in geographical
miles. The actual number of English miles travelled
over would be in reality little short of a thousand.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his frightful experiences, Park considered
that his “journey plainly demonstrates&mdash;first,
that with common prudence any quantity of merchandise
may be transported from the Gambia to the Niger
without danger of being robbed by the natives; second,
that if this journey be performed in the dry season, one
may calculate on losing not more than three, or at most
four men, out of fifty.”</p>

<p>We would naturally have expected him to add as a
third conclusion, that under no circumstance should
Europeans be employed in such a caravan except as
conductors, or it might be as guards. That conclusion,
however, he apparently did not reach&mdash;indeed, we look
in vain throughout his journal for any indication that
he was at all aware of the frightful nature of his
blunder in starting only with Europeans.</p>

<p>And yet before him was the tangible fact, that of
thirty-four soldiers and four carpenters who left the
Gambia with him, only seven entered Bammaku, while
Isaaco and his attendants were all alive and hearty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
though much of the white men’s work had fallen upon
them in addition to their own.</p>

<p>Three days after their arrival at Bammaku the
travellers continued their way. Martyn, with the men
and the donkeys, proceeded by land, while Park, Anderson,
and the goods glided down the river in canoes, at
the rate of five knots an hour, without the necessity of
paddling. At their starting point the river was a mile
broad; but further down, where it passes through a
range of hills and forms rapids, it attains twice that
breadth. Here the great mass of water is gathered
into three principal channels, along which it rushes
with much noise, and a speed which made Park sigh as
the frail canoes containing all his precious stores sped
into the sweeping tide, and seemed threatened with
momentary destruction.</p>

<p>Two such rapids and three smaller ones were safely
passed during the afternoon. At one place an elephant
was seen standing on an island, so near that if Park
had not been too ill, he would have had a shot at it.</p>

<p>At several points the canoes ran considerable danger
of being upset by hippos. At night the party landed,
and after a supper of rice and fresh-water turtle, spent
a night exposed to the violence of a tropic storm.</p>

<p>At Marrabu, where they arrived on the second day,
a halt was called, while Isaaco was despatched to Sego
with a message and a present for Mansong, king of
Bambarra, whose good offices were likely to prove invaluable,
ruling as he did over the whole country from
Bammaku to Timbuktu. While awaiting his messenger’s
return, Park, who had been suffering from dysentery ever
since his arrival on the river, and found himself failing
fast under its deadly attacks, dosed himself with calomel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
till it affected his throat to such a degree that he could
neither speak nor sleep for six days. The experiment was
successful, however, as regards stopping the progress of
the disease, and his health speedily began to improve.</p>

<p>The interval of waiting to which he was now subjected
was a time of extreme anxiety. The check
which all the physical difficulties of the march and the
death of three-fourths of his men had failed to give
him might be effected by the will of Mansong. On the
decision of the negro ruler depended Park’s further movements.
A Yes might assure the complete realisation of
all his dearest hopes&mdash;a No would be their death-knell.</p>

<p>Each day brought its crop of unfavourable rumours.
Among others came the report that Mansong had killed
Isaaco with his own hands, and intended to finish off
the white men in a similar summary fashion. Happily
this and kindred stories proved to be pure inventions,
and after a fortnight’s delay a messenger arrived to
conduct Park to Sego, bringing with him an encouraging
account of Mansong’s disposition towards him.</p>

<p>The drastic methods of the emissaries of negro kings
were well illustrated by the following incident. A native
refusing to give up a canoe for the messenger’s use, the
latter not only seized the canoe in question, but cut the
owner across the forehead with his sword, broke the
brother’s head with a paddle, and finally made a slave
of the son. Before such deeds criticism was dumb.</p>

<p>And now all seemed about to go well with the expedition.
Cradled on the majestic bosom of the great river,
with toils and worry over, its leader could afford to
allow himself to be lulled into a sweet dreamland, in
which he saw himself gliding peacefully towards the
Congo and the Atlantic. Of goods he had still sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
for his object&mdash;of men, too, there were enough; and
with mind thus comparatively at ease, he could give
himself up to the enjoyment of the beautiful views of
“this immense river&mdash;sometimes as smooth as a mirror,
at others ruffled by a gentle breeze, but at all times
sweeping along at the rate of six or seven miles an
hour.”</p>

<p>In two days Yamina was reached, and a third brought
the party to Sami, where once more they halted while
the messenger went forward to inform Mansong of
their proximity, and ask instructions concerning them.
Two days later Isaaco joined them from Sego. He
reported that Mansong’s position was very neutral.
The king showed impatience when the subject of the
white men was broached, though he had said that they
were at liberty to pass down the river. In addition he
gave Isaaco to understand that he wanted no direct
dealings with Park.</p>

<p>On the following day a king’s messenger arrived to
receive Mansong’s present from Park’s own hands, as
well as to hear the object of his visit. In his speech
the traveller told how he was the same poor white man
who, after being plundered by the Moors, was so hospitably
received by their king, whose generous conduct
had made his name much respected in the country of
the Europeans. He then proceeded to point out what
a trading people his (the traveller’s) were, and how all
the articles of value that reached the country of Mansong
were made by them, being afterwards brought by
Moors and others by long and expensive routes, which
made everything extremely dear. That these European
goods might be brought cheaper to Bambarra for the
mutual benefit of whites and blacks, his king had sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
him to see if a short and easy route could not be found
by way of the Niger. If such was discovered, then
the white men’s vessels would come direct all the way
from Europe and supply them with abundance of all
their good things at cheap prices.</p>

<p>In reply to this speech the emissary said that the
white man’s journey was a good one, and prayed that
God might prosper him in it. Mansong would protect
him. The sight of the presents added to the friendly
feelings thus expressed.</p>

<p>To dash Park’s joy at the favourable aspect of affairs
two more soldiers died&mdash;one of fever, the other of dysentery&mdash;leaving
him with only four men, besides Anderson
and Martyn.</p>

<p>In a couple of days the king sent a further message
intimating that the white strangers would be protected,
and that wherever his power and influence extended the
road would be open to them. If they went East, no man
would harm them till beyond Timbuktu. Westward,
the name of Mansong’s stranger would be a safe password
through the land to the Atlantic itself. If they
wished to sail down the river, they were at liberty to
build boats at any town they pleased.</p>

<p>As Mansong had never once expressed a wish to see
him, and seemingly had some superstitious fear of the
possible consequence, Park fixed upon Sansandig as the
best place to prepare for his new adventure. Here,
too, he would have more quiet, and would be more
exempt from begging, than within the daily range of
the king’s officials.</p>

<p>In his passage from Sami to Sansandig, Park was
attacked by a violent fever, which rendered him temporarily
delirious. According to the sufferer, the heat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
was so terrific as to have been equal to the roasting of
a sirloin, and there was neither covering to ward it off
nor slightest puff of wind to temper it.</p>

<p>On reaching his destination the traveller was received
by his old friend Kunti Mamadi, who placed the necessary
huts at his disposal. On the following day two
more of his men expired, and it began to look as if at
the very moment when success seemed assured he was
to be doomed to lose all. So frightfully were they all
reduced at this time, and so little able to look after each
other, that, unmolested, hyenas entered the dead men’s
hut, dragged one of them out, and devoured him.</p>

<p>From Park’s journal we get an interesting glimpse
of Sansandig, with its 11,000 inhabitants and its
mosques, of which two were by “no means inelegant.”
But, as in all African towns, it was the market-place
which was the centre of life and interest. From
morning till night the square was crowded with busy
groups of people gathered round the various mat-covered
stalls which formed the shops, each containing its own
speciality&mdash;beads in every gorgeous hue to catch the
eye of the ornament-loving sex, antimony to darken and
beautify the tips of the ladies’ eyelids, rings and bracelets
to attract wandering male glances to female feet
and hands. In more substantial houses were scarlet
cloths, silks, amber, and other valuable commodities
which had found their way across the desert from
Morocco or Tripoli&mdash;over roads marked out by the
skeletons of slaves and camels who had sunk down
to perish under the frightful hardships of the route.
Vegetables, meat, salt, &amp;c., each had their own stalls&mdash;beer,
too, in large quantities, near a booth where leather
work found its purchasers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the everyday state of the square; but the
scene was still more animated and interesting on the
occasion of the Tuesday weekly market. On that day
enormous crowds of people gathered from the whole
surrounding country to buy and sell wholesale, and
many were the delightful glimpses of native life and
character continually presenting themselves to the eyes
of the observant traveller. He even found a means
whereby to turn the market to his own advantage.</p>

<p>Mansong being slow in carrying out his promise to
supply canoes to be turned into boats, Park opened a
shop himself for the purpose of exchanging some of his
articles for cowries, by which he hoped to purchase the
necessary means of transport. He made such a tempting
display that he had at once a great run of business,
and became the envy of all the merchants of the place.
In one day he secured 25,000 cowries.</p>

<p>While thus peacefully employed, every effort was
being made on the part of the Moors and native
merchants in order to set Mansong against the white
man, and get him killed, or sent back by the way he had
come. They even did not hesitate to say that his object
was to kill the king and his sons by means of charms.
Mansong, however, was not to be prevailed on by such
instigations, though his behaviour showed some belief
in the reported magical powers.</p>

<p>After much delay, Park succeeded in obtaining two
canoes, to join which together he and Bolton, the sole
remaining capable man, now set themselves with great
vigour. The rotten parts were replaced, the holes were
repaired, and after eighteen days’ hard labour the united
canoes were launched and christened His Majesty’s
schooner <i>Joliba</i>, the length being forty feet, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
breadth six. Being flat-bottomed, it drew only one foot
of water.</p>

<p>While Park was thus toiling with feverish energy to
complete his preparations, Martyn seems to have been
taking life very easily. From a letter written from
Sansandig to a friend at Goree we get an idea of the
sort of man he was, and how much he assisted in the
work of the expedition. “Whitebread’s beer,” says the
Lieutenant, “is nothing to what we get at this place,
as I feel by my head this morning, having been drinking
all night with a Moor, and ended by giving him
an excellent thrashing.” Could the contrast possibly be
greater between Park and this man&mdash;the one possessed
with a consuming desire to accomplish a work seemingly
beyond mortal power, slaving with the strength
of half-a-dozen ordinary men, uncrushed by a myriad
misfortunes, his hero’s spirit equal to every difficulty
and danger; the other spending his time in drunken
orgies, seemingly as careless of his life as indifferent to
the great mission that was partly his.</p>

<p>The last and worst stroke of evil fortune that could
befall Park came upon him in the form of his brother-in-law
Anderson’s death, which occurred on the 28th
October. He had been Park’s special support in all
his trials, ever the one to whom he could open his heart,
or from whom he could seek advice and encouragement.
His thoughts and feelings on the occasion, Park, with
characteristic reserve, does not put on paper, though he
cannot help observing “that no event which took place
during the journey ever threw the smallest gloom on
my mind till I laid Mr. Anderson in the grave. I then
felt myself as if left a second time lonely and friendless
amidst the wilds of Africa.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>THE LAST OF PARK.</i></span></h2>

<p>By the middle of November the last preparations for the
great voyage on the Niger were completed. Isaaco had
been paid off, and one Amadi Fatuma, a native of Karson,
and a great traveller, hired in his place to guide the
party to Kashna, which Park still believed to be on the
river. To Isaaco, Park’s precious journal was entrusted
for conveyance home.</p>

<p>On the 17th November, dating from “On board of
H.M. schooner <i>Joliba</i>, at anchor off Sansandig,” Park
wrote to Lord Camden. After some remarks on his
situation, he continues&mdash;</p>

<p>“From this account I am afraid that your Lordship
will be apt to consider matters as in a very hopeless
state, but I assure you I am far from desponding.
With the assistance of one of the soldiers I have changed
a large canoe into a tolerably good schooner, on board
of which I shall set sail to the east, with the fixed resolution
to discover the termination of the Niger or perish
in the attempt. I have heard nothing I can depend on
respecting the remote course of this mighty stream, but
I am more and more inclined to think that it can end
nowhere but in the sea.</p>

<p>“My dear friend Mr. Anderson, and likewise Mr.
Scott, are both dead; but though all the Europeans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
who are with me should die, and though I were myself
half dead, I would still persevere, and if I could not
succeed in the object of my journey, I would at least die
on the Niger. If I succeed in the object of my journey,
I expect to be in England in the month of May or June,
by way of the West Indies.”</p>

<p>On the 19th he wrote to his wife&mdash;</p>

<p>“ ... I am afraid that, impressed with a woman’s
fears and the anxieties of a wife, you may be led to consider
my situation as a great deal worse than it is....
The rains are completely over, and the healthy season
has commenced, so that there is no danger of sickness,
and I have still a sufficient force to protect me from
any insult in sailing down the river to the sea.</p>

<p>“We have already embarked all our things, and shall
sail the moment I have finished this letter. I do not
intend to stop nor land anywhere till we reach the coast,
which I suppose will be some time in the end of January....
I think it not unlikely but that I shall be in England
before you receive this.... We this morning
have done with all intercourse with the natives. The
sails are now being hoisted for our departure to the
coast.”</p>

<p>These letters are full of brave words, yet they do not
express one iota more than what Park was capable of.
They breathe his remarkable personality in every line.
They show the heroic spirit that does not know the word
impossible, that does not know when it is beaten&mdash;that
having once set itself a task, is incapable of turning
back. They speak eloquently of a stubborn resolution
which only death itself can render powerless, and such a
resolution as the world has rarely seen.</p>

<p>It is almost impossible to realise the position of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
hero at the moment when he prepared to embark on one
of the most perilous and uncertain voyages history records.
In some aspects it deserves to rank with the
voyage of Columbus across the Atlantic. The bourne
was equally uncertain, the distance not so very much
less, the perils quite as great. It might even be said
that compared with that of Park, the enterprise of
Columbus was most hopeful. Columbus, too, had always
the option of turning back. For Park there was no
such door of escape. Success or death was his only
choice, and even success might mean captivity or worse,
the best geographer of the time holding that the Niger
termination was not in the ocean, but in the heart of
the continent. If he proved right, how many were
the chances against Park’s ever finding his way out
again.</p>

<p>It is to be remembered, in addition, that this voyage
of from 2000 to 3000 miles&mdash;supposing the Niger to be
the same as the Congo&mdash;was not embarked upon in the
heyday of the party’s hopes, but after an unparalleled
series of misfortunes and a frightful tale of death.</p>

<p>For sole means of carrying out this wonderful enterprise
Park had nothing better than an unwieldy half-rotten
canoe, and a crew consisting of an officer wholly
unsuited to the work, three European privates, of whom
one was mad and the others sick, and lastly, Amadi
Fatuma, the guide, and three slaves&mdash;nine men in all.</p>

<p>With this “sufficient force to protect me from insult,”
the canoe had to be navigated without a pilot for
hundreds of miles along a river studded at parts with
dangerous rocks, and everywhere infested by equally
dangerous hippos&mdash;a river whose banks were occupied
for much of the way by fanatical Moors and Tuaregs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
while beyond were unknown tribes of cannibal savages
and other bloodthirsty natives.</p>

<p>But nothing could daunt the intrepid explorer&mdash;nothing
make him waver in his “fixed resolution to
discover the termination of the Niger or die in the
attempt.”</p>

<p>Thus spiritually armed and inspired, and thus materially
supported, with the writing of his last words to
the world, the sails of the <i>Joliba</i> were unfurled to the
wind, and like Ulysses of old, Park pushed off from
land bent on some work of noble note. And though
made “weak by time and fate,” still “strong in will, to
strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield” till death itself
should close his toilsome struggle, or Ocean once more
happily receive him on its broad bosom, and bear him
to the “Happy Isles” and the blessed guerdon of his
accomplished work.</p>

<p>The die was cast, and down the great river he glided
towards the untravelled countries of the east and south&mdash;towards
the heart of savage Africa, and the deep darkness
of the Unexplored.</p>

<p>His journals and letters in the hands of the faithful
Isaaco safely reached the coast and afterwards Europe,
thrilling all true-born men and women with the unparalleled
tale of travel they so simply yet graphically
unfolded. All waited with eager impatience for the
reappearance of the hero. Speculation was rife as to
his point of exit, or whether he would ever be heard
of more.</p>

<p>May of 1806 passed into June without bringing
further news. The year 1806 gave place to 1807, and
then fears as to the ultimate fate of the expedition
began to find expression. To strengthen these, rumours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
from West Africa reached home that native traders
from the interior reported a disastrous close to the
enterprise. With each succeeding month these reports
grew in number and consistency, till Government could
no longer ignore them, and determined to send a reliable
native to the Niger to make special inquiries.</p>

<p>For this task Isaaco was engaged, and in January
1810 he left Senegal. In October of the same year he
reached Sansandig, where he was so fortunate as to
find Amadi Fatuma, the guide Park had taken with
him down the Niger.</p>

<p>On seeing Isaaco, Amadi broke into tears and lamentations,
crying out, “They are all dead, they are lost
for ever!” His story was soon told. The substance
of it was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>On leaving Sansandig, Park, in pursuance of his
plan not to hold communication with the people on
land, so as if possible to avoid attack or detention,
pursued his course down the middle of the stream. At
Silla another slave was added to the party, and at
Jenné a present was sent to the head man, though no
landing was made at either place.</p>

<p>On reaching the point where the Niger divides to
form the island of Jinbala, they were attacked by three
canoes armed with pikes and bows and arrows, which
were repulsed by force on the failure of more peaceful
methods.</p>

<p>At a place called Rakhara a similar attempt was
made to stop the progress of the <i>Joliba</i>, and a third
near Timbuktu. On each occasion the natives were
driven back with the loss of many killed and wounded.</p>

<p>On passing Timbuktu, the country of Gurma and the
lands of the Tuaregs lay before them. In this part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
the river a determined attempt to dispute their passage
was made by seven canoes; but the natives having no
guns, were easily repulsed by the crew of the <i>Joliba</i>,
which, though reduced to eight in number, were well
supplied with muskets, constantly kept ready for action.
Here another soldier died. Further on the <i>Joliba</i> was
attacked by sixty canoes, but without serious result.</p>

<p>If the guide is to be trusted, Martyn seems to have
enjoyed this part of the work to the full&mdash;so much so,
indeed, that once, after a good deal of bloodshed, Amadi
seized the Lieutenant’s hand and begged him to desist,
there being no further necessity for fighting. So enraged
was Martyn, that the humane interference would have
cost Amadi his life, but for Park’s intervention.</p>

<p>Some distance beyond the scene of this battle the
<i>Joliba</i> struck on the rocks, and during the confusion
which ensued a hippo nearly completed their discomfiture
by rushing at the boat, which it would have
destroyed or upset, but for the timely firing of the
men’s guns. With great difficulty the canoe was got off
without having suffered any material damage.</p>

<p>The party had now reached the centre of the ancient
empire of Songhay, and everything was going as well as
could be expected. They had still sufficient provisions
to make landing unnecessary.</p>

<p>At a place called Kaffo three more canoes had to be
driven back, and further on the guide, on landing to
buy some milk, was seized by the natives. Park, seeing
this, promptly laid hold of two canoes which had come
alongside, and let their owners understand that unless
his man was released he would kill them all and carry
off their canoes. This threat had the required result, the
guide being released, and amicable relations resumed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>Beyond the point where this incident happened, the
river became difficult to navigate. It was broken up
by islands and rocks into three narrow passages. The
place is probably that marked in Barth’s map, some
seventy miles south of Gargo, the former capital of Songhay.
The first passage tried was found to be guarded
by armed men, “which,” says the guide, “caused great
uneasiness to us, especially to me, and I seriously promised
never to pass there again without making considerable
charitable donations to the poor.” On trying
a second channel the party was not molested.</p>

<p>A few days later they reached the Haussa country, probably
near the Gulbi-n-Gindi, which comes from Kebbi,
the western of the then independent states. Here, according
to Amadi, his agreement ended, though, according
to Park’s letters, he was to have gone as far as Kashna.
Before separating from his guide Park wrote down the
names of the necessaries of life and some useful phrases
in the dialects of the remaining countries through which
he had to pass. This task occupied two days, during
which the <i>Joliba</i> remained at anchor, but without landing
any of her crew.</p>

<p>Though thus losing his interpreter, and adding in
consequence to the dangers of the voyage by having no
one through whom to communicate when necessary with
the natives, Park had every reason to be hopeful. He
had now sailed over a thousand miles down the river
without any serious mishap, though the way had lain
through the country of the Moors, and their equally
fanatical co-religionists the Tuaregs. Ahead lay the land
of the negroes, among whom, all things considered, he
had ever found a kindly welcome and hospitable treatment.
Especially encouraging was the fact that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Niger was flowing due south&mdash;consequently towards the
Atlantic, and not to the inland swamps of Rennell’s
theories.</p>

<p>There was therefore no great reason to consider the
want of an interpreter as an important drawback, and
consequently no attempt was made to induce Amadi to
go further than Yauri, the next district to the south of
the Gulbi-n-Gindi. Here Amadi went ashore, and after
exchanging presents on the part of Park with the king,
Al Hadj, or the “Pilgrim,” bought more provisions, to
enable the white men to continue their way without
landing. This, though probably a necessary business,
was destined to prove fatal to the prospects of the
expedition. The cupidity of the natives was aroused by
the wealth which the strangers were believed to have
with them&mdash;a sample of which was afforded by the
presents sent to the king.</p>

<p>Immediately to the south of Yauri, the low, flat valley
of the Niger contracts to a glen or gorge, where the subtending
sandstone hills pass into abrupt and precipitous
masses of hard metamorphic rock, and break up the
channel of the river by dangerous rocks and islands
occupied by villages. Thus narrowed and divided the
waters of the river sweep onward in three branches&mdash;one
of them easy to navigate; the others difficult at flood
time, and almost impossible when the river is low.</p>

<p>During the delay at Yauri the news of the strangers’
coming either spread in the ordinary way to Bussa, or
was conveyed by special messenger, and preparations
were made to stop them.</p>

<div class="center">
<img id="i_265" src="images/i_265.png" width="535" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE BUSSA RAPIDS.</p></div>

<p>Unconscious of the dangers ahead, Park left Yauri
and continued his way south. Having no one acquainted
with the river in his canoe, he unluckily struck upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
worst of the three channels, and rushed to his doom.
Once in the sweep of the current to turn back was impossible.
To land was equally out of the question even
had it been possible, for to right and left the rocks and
islands were crowded with natives in war array bent
on stopping the intruders. The energy and attention
of the handful of travellers was divided between the
double danger&mdash;the rapids and rocks around and ahead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
of them, and the weapons hurtling through the air.
Two of the slaves were speedily killed; for the rest there
was no other course but to keep onward, alternately firing
and paddling, ever hoping to make good their escape.
A little more and they would be out of danger. Before
they were aware, however, the <i>Joliba</i> rushed into the
grip of a hidden cleft rock and there stuck fast. With
desperate energy each man seized his paddle, and mindful
only of the supreme peril of the moment, plied it with the
strength of one who works for dear life. In vain&mdash;the
<i>Joliba</i> would not yield to their frantic efforts. With
delighted yells the natives gathered on the neighbouring
rocks, and sure of their prey, plied their weapons with
renewed zeal.</p>

<p>The last resource was to lighten the canoe, and everything
of weight was accordingly thrown into the river.
That too proved useless, and now Park and his little
band of followers knew they had reached the culminating
point of their misfortunes. For a time they
fought on as if determined to sell their lives dearly,
but at length desisted, struck with the futility of their
efforts. Their goods were gone&mdash;their number was reduced
to four. To continue fighting was only further to
enrage their enemies. What were the feelings of the
hero at this supreme moment of disaster&mdash;what his last
determination, who shall say?</p>

<p>Amadi tells us that in the end Park took hold of one
white man and Martyn of the other, and thus united they
all four jumped into the river, whether to die together,
or with the intention of mutually assisting each other,
will never be known. The latter supposition is the
more probable, for with Park while there was life there
was hope. In any case the result was the same. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
Niger claimed him as its own, and since to unlock its
secrets was not to be his, what more fitting for him
than death beneath its rushing waters.</p>

<p>Of the party only one slave remained alive. Of the
contents of the canoe the sole articles left were a
sword-belt, which the King of Yauri utilised as a
horse-girth, and some books, one of which has reached
England.</p>

<p>The guide did not escape scathless any more than the
other members of the expedition. Scarcely had he taken
leave of Park, when he was seized and loaded with
chains, remaining in imprisonment for some months.
His first business on obtaining his freedom was to
find out the sole survivor of the expedition, and learn
from him the manner of its leader’s death. Having
satisfied himself as far as might be on this point, he
returned home to Sansandig, from which rumour gradually
carried his sad tale to the coast, and resulted in the
mission of Isaaco.</p>

<p>To obtain the sword-belt, and otherwise substantiate
Amadi’s story, Isaaco despatched a Fulah to Yauri.
The Fulah succeeded in stealing the belt, and gathered
confirmation of the tale of disaster, whereupon Isaaco
set out for the coast with the melancholy tidings and
solitary relic.</p>

<p>With the many the tragic story obtained immediate
credence. A few there were, however, who refused to
give up hope, though that hope was but the offspring of
their love and ardent wishes. Among these was Mrs.
Park, who to her dying day, thirty years after the
above events, clung to the belief that her husband was
yet alive, and would some day be found.</p>

<p>The Government, not unmindful of their duty to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
family of such a heroic servant, granted Mrs. Park a
small pension, which she continued to receive till her
death in 1840.</p>

<p>Her children as they grew up speedily showed that
they inherited much of the spirit of their father.
Mungo, the eldest, obtained a commission in the Indian
army. But he had not his father’s constitution, and he
died ten days after landing at Bombay. His younger
brother, Archibald, was more fortunate in the same field
of honour, and rose to the rank of Colonel.</p>

<p>But it was the second son, Thomas, who seemed most
largely to have inherited the adventurous nature of his
father. He, like his mother, never lost belief in the idea
that his father was somewhere a prisoner in the heart
of Africa. Thither, in the ardent, impulsive days of
youth, his thoughts perpetually turned, till the desire
of ascertaining the truth possessed him as strongly as
the solution of the mystery of the Niger had formerly
possessed Park himself. But by this time the Parks
were alone in their belief, and unsupported, the impetuous
young fellow was next to helpless. In secret,
however, he continued to scheme and plan all the more,
ever with the one object in view.</p>

<p>At length in the year 1827 he embarked on board
a vessel bound for the South Seas. In some way or
other he contrived to leave the ship and reach the Gold
Coast, determined now to carry out by himself his long
cherished desire to discover his father’s fate.</p>

<p>The following letter, dated Accra, 1827, tells all we
know of his plans:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dearest Mother</span>,&mdash;I was in hopes I should
have been back before you were aware of my absence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
I went off&mdash;now that the murder is out&mdash;entirely from
fear of hurting your feelings. I did not write to you
lest you should not be satisfied. Depend upon it, my
dearest mother, I shall return safe. You know what a
curious fellow I am, therefore don’t be afraid for me.
Besides, it was my duty&mdash;my filial duty&mdash;to go, and I
shall yet raise the name of Park. You ought rather to
rejoice that I took it into my head. Give my kindest
love to my sister. Tell her I think the boat would
do very well for the Niger. I shall be back in three
years at the most&mdash;perhaps in one. God bless you, my
dearest mother, and believe me to be, your most affectionate
and dutiful son,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Thomas Park</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>Thereafter an ominous silence followed. Like the
elder Park, the hot-headed young fellow, whom we cannot
help loving for his folly&mdash;knowing as we do its
mainspring&mdash;disappeared from sight in the Dark Continent,
whence only vague rumours ever came back,
sorrow-laden, telling of a speedy and bloody close to
his wild yet heroic mission.</p>

<p>And so fatally ended the connection of the Park
family with the exploration of the River Niger, and
thus closed the first great chapter in the history of the
opening up of Inner Africa.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>THE FULAH REVOLUTION.</i></span></h2>

<p>Simultaneously with the commencement of Park’s
work of exploration, an event of almost equal moment
in the history of the Niger basin had begun to germinate.
This was the phenomenal rise to a position
of immense political and religious importance of the
Fulahs&mdash;a people known among the Haussa as Fillani,
and in Bornu as Fillatah.</p>

<p>As Park was the forerunner of Christian enterprise,
so Othman dan Fodiyo, a simple Fulah Malaam or
teacher, in raising the banner of Islam, marked the
revival of the political and religious spirit of Mohammedanism
in the Central and Western Sudan.</p>

<p>We have seen how the huge empire of Songhay
crumbled into pieces before the musketeers of a Moorish
sultan&mdash;how with its political influence went its civilising
influence, and whole kingdoms and provinces fell
back into the old idolatry and barbarism.</p>

<p>Similarly and almost contemporaneously, Bornu,
largely though not so entirely, lost its old military
power and progressive force. The Haussa States, left
to themselves, showed a like degenerative tendency, and
largely lapsed into the old heathen ways.</p>

<p>But in all the mass of idolatry was a leaven of
quickening influence, which prevented it from becom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>ing
altogether dead and sodden. From Lake Chad to
the Atlantic there was scattered one remarkable race
who forgot not God, neither lapsed into the abominations
of the infidel. Though without political status,
and holding no better position than that of semi-serfs&mdash;being,
moreover, spread broadcast in small groups as
shepherds&mdash;they yet had in them a bond of union and an
inspiring force which supported them in all their trials,
and kept them from racial annihilation.</p>

<div class="center">
<img id="i_271" src="images/i_271.png" width="600" height="429" alt="" />
<p class="caption">GROUP OF FULAHS.</p></div>

<p>That race was the Fulah, and their bond of union was
the religion of Islam.</p>

<p>Where they came from is unknown. Everything relating
to them is a matter of conjecture, though in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
Sudanese chronicles we find various allusions to them
extending back several centuries.</p>

<p>Their well-chiselled features, straight wiry hair, and
copper-coloured skin, all distinctly mark them off as not
African, and point towards the East as the cradle of
their race. Still more, their well-developed skulls and
high intellectual average place them on an altogether
higher level in the scale of humanity than any of the
negro or Bantu races among whom they settled.</p>

<p>At some remote period, we may safely conjecture, they
immigrated from the East, and gradually moved westward&mdash;not
as warrior-conquerors, but as peace-loving
shepherds, whose knowledge of cattle, &amp;c., made them
welcome additions to every country they reached. Nomadic
in habit, and depending for subsistence on their
flocks and herds, it was impossible for them to settle in
large numbers in any one place&mdash;the country being
already occupied by the negro inhabitants. Accordingly
it was ever necessary for them to move westward, leaving
behind them only such numbers as could conveniently
get a living.</p>

<p>By the fourteenth or fifteenth century the Fulahs had
reached the watersheds of the Niger and the Gambia.
Here the migratory tide was stopped by physical and
other causes. The country beyond proved to be less
adapted for pastoral pursuits, and possibly was already
thickly populated.</p>

<p>There being no further outlet westward, the newcomers
naturally accumulated as does the dammed back
stream. They increased in numbers, and correspondingly
in power, till they became of no small importance,
and founded for themselves a kingdom which has
been already mentioned under the name of Fulahdu.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>When Islam crossed the desert and found its way
in the ninth and tenth centuries into the Sudan, the
Fulahs were the very first to become converts to the
new religion. Their temperament, their higher intellectual
development, made them more quickly susceptible
to the new influences, and hence it was that while as yet
the great mass of the aborigines were still infidel, the
Fulahs with one voice were proclaiming their belief in
Allah and His Prophet. Persecution, as in the case
of other religions, had only the result of burning the
tenets of Islam deeper into their souls, causing their
faith to shine with a clearer and more spiritual light
to the edification and instruction of the surrounding
idolaters. In the Western Sudan, where they enjoyed,
or came to enjoy, an independent existence, Islam spread
among the Fulahs with special rapidity; and with the
fall of Songhay and the crippling of the influence of
Timbuktu, they became the chief propagators of Mohammedanism
and the great encouragers of learning by
means of mosques and schools&mdash;rarely by the power
of fire and the sword. Not only did they and their co-religionists
of neighbouring tribes, the Mandingoes and
the Jolofs, thus spread a knowledge of the One God&mdash;they
at the same time did an equally noble work in
arraying themselves against the rapidly advancing flood
of gin which Christian Europe was pouring into their
country. With that traffic they would have nothing to
do, and unlike so many of our Christian merchants, no
consideration of profit would tempt them to a compromise
between their conscience and the lust for gain.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Fulahs of the kingdoms of the interior
had much to do to hold their own among their Pagan
masters. Their position was most galling to a race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
which knew themselves infinitely superior to those
whom they were obliged to own as masters&mdash;more bitter
still that they, the inheritors of the promises, should be
ruled by idolaters and men whose portion was Gehenna.
Broken up as they were into little groups scattered
over an enormous area, what could they do? The answer
to that question was speedily forthcoming. They had,
as we have shown, the necessary bond of union and the
inspiring spiritual force to make them fight as one man
for a common end. They only needed the leader to
utilise this force and bring it into action. Such a man
is never wanting when the times demand him, and he
in this case was forthcoming in the person of Othman,
the Imam or religious sheik of the Fulah of Gober, the
northern of the Haussa States.</p>

<p>Under the influence of this sheik the Fulah of that
region were roused to a state of religious fervour such
as they had never known before. His fiery eloquence
touched their excitable and imaginative nature as he
brought home to them the shame of their semi-enslaved
position. The fires of discontent were thus set smouldering,
and required but a little more fanning to cause
them to blaze into the flames of rebellion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile their Haussa ruler, Bawa, was not blind
to the dangerous ferment existing among them, and
fearing the results, summoned Othman to his presence,
and severely reprimanded him. This was sufficient for
the proud and enthusiastic “Believer.” He left Bawa’s
presence only to raise the standard of revolt&mdash;the sacred
banner of Islam. The effect was electric. In response
to his summons the Fulah at once gathered around him
in an enthusiastic army.</p>

<p>But they were mostly shepherds&mdash;men of peace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
unaccustomed to the use of arms; and they could
not be at once transformed into successful warriors.
Consequently at first they met with discomfiture and
defeat in every encounter. Had they been fighting for
themselves the movement would undoubtedly have collapsed
at the first rude shock of arms. But happily for
them they had a higher interest at heart. They fought
for God and His Prophet, whose instruments they believed
themselves to be. In such a warfare there could
be no doubt in their minds as to whose would ultimately
be the victory. With ever-growing zeal they returned
to the charge, stimulated in their glorious crusade by
their leader Othman’s religious songs and fiery words,
which told them that theirs was a cause for which it
was much to live and fight, but even more to die, if it
should be God’s will.</p>

<p>Thus led and encouraged, the Fulah grew in experience
of battle and the use of arms. The hordes of
shepherds were gradually beaten into a disciplined
army of warriors, and from defeat rose to victory.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Othman and his ever-victorious
army burst forth from Gober on their irresistible career,
filling the wild wastes of Central African heathendom
with their cry of “None but the One God,” till the
whole of the Western and Central Sudan, from Lake
Chad to the Atlantic, acknowledged more or less temporarily
the political supremacy of the Fulah. Yet it
was no mere temporal power that Othman and his
people sought to establish&mdash;theirs was a conquest for
God. They acted but as His agents. Before them
fetishism and all its degrading rites disappeared. No
longer did the natives bow down to stocks and stones,
but to Allah, the One God. Once more, as in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
palmy days of Songhay and Bornu, schools and mosques
sprang up throughout the land, and the Greatness, the
Compassionateness, and the All-embracing Mercy of the
Ruler of the Universe were taught to natives released
from the foul blight of idolatry in its worst form.</p>

<p>In this work of releasing the Faithful from their
bondage to heathen taskmasters, and bringing new
light in a forcible fashion to the barbarous and breechless
natives, the Fulah did not stop till from every
village of the Central Sudan there was heard in the grey
dawn of the tropic morning the stentorian voice of the
negro Mueddin, announcing that prayer was better than
sleep&mdash;bringing from out the faintly illumined houses the
devout Moslems to humble their faces in the dust, and
acknowledge their utter faith in and dependence on
Allah.</p>

<p>No less thoroughly was the material welfare of the
people cared for. “The laws of the Koran were in his
(Othman’s) time strictly put in force, not only among
the Fillahtah (Fulah), but the negroes and the Arabs;
and the whole country, when not in a state of war, was
so well regulated, that it was a common saying that a
woman might travel with a casket of gold upon her head
from one end of the Fillahtah dominions to the other.”
So wrote Clapperton a few years after the death of
Othman, as eye-witness of the wonderful revolution
effected by the Fulah.</p>

<p>Unhappily the religious fervour of the remarkable
leader speedily developed into religious mania, and ended
in his death in 1817.</p>

<p>On the death of Othman, the huge empire he had
raised was divided between his sons Bello and Abd
Allahi. To the former was given Sokoto and all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
east and south, while to the latter fell the western provinces
along the Niger, with Gandu as capital. The
countries to the west of the Niger, including Massina,
became independent under Ahmed Lebbo, one of
Othman’s lieutenants, who conquered that region immediately
before the death of Othman.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>NEW ENTERPRISES AND NEW THEORIES.</i></span></h2>

<p>As we have seen, Park’s second expedition was fruitful
in nothing but disaster, and the legacy of experience
that helps others to success.</p>

<p>The journal Isaaco brought back from the Niger did
not add anything to our knowledge of the river, and so
little did Amadi Fatuma’s narrative supplement it as
to the results of the voyage down the stream to Bussa,
that in the map attached to the published journal and
biographical notice in 1816, Park’s furthest point is
placed only some eighty miles to the E.S.E. of Timbuktu,
instead of nearly 700 miles in a straight line S.E.</p>

<p>There was one geographer, however, more far-seeing
than the others, who, though at the time unheeded, struck
upon the real solution of the problem of the Niger’s termination.
This was M. Richard, a German, who published
his views on the subject in the “Ephemerides
Geographique” as far back as 1808. These, briefly
stated, were as follows. The Niger, after reaching
Wangara, takes a direction towards the south, and being
joined by other rivers from that part of Africa, makes a
great turn thence towards the south-west, pursuing its
course till it approaches the north-eastern extremity of the
Gulf of Guinea, where it divides and discharges itself by
different channels into the Atlantic, after having formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
an immense delta, of which the Rio del Rey constitutes
the eastern, and the Rio Formosa or Benin the western
branch.</p>

<p>Never was a better instance of a mental discovery of
a geographical fact. Richard’s hypothesis is a graphic
description of the actual geography of the middle and
lower Niger. This of course was not to be recognised
by the world, before whose eyes the Kong Mountains
ever loomed up as an impassable barrier running across
the suggested line of drainage. Till these could be
removed, turned aside, or broken up, no geographer
was prepared to allow that the Niger could possibly
discharge itself into the Gulf of Guinea.</p>

<p>Mungo Park had left one legacy of theory behind
him, viz., that the Niger and the Congo were one. What
was known of his last voyage in nowise helped to disabuse
men of that idea&mdash;on the contrary, it obtained
more widely than ever.</p>

<p>To set at rest once for all this important question, the
Government, undeterred by the disastrous termination
of the last expedition, determined to fit out another on
an even larger scale, and in spite of the dire fate which
had befallen Park and his companions, there were not
wanting plenty of ardent spirits to risk all the dangers
of a similar enterprise.</p>

<p>To ensure success the expedition was divided into two
parts&mdash;one to follow Park’s route more or less closely
and descend the Niger; the other to ascend the Congo,
haply to meet half way, if the fates were propitious.</p>

<p>Captain Tuckey was the leader of the Congo section;
and along with him went a botanist, a geologist, a
naturalist, a comparative anatomist, a gentleman volunteer,
and fifty of a crew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>The party left England on the 16th February 1816,
and reached the mouth of the Congo in five months and
a half. The impression they received on entering the
river was one of disappointment, the river appearing as
one of second class magnitude instead of the gigantic
stream they had been taught to expect.</p>

<p>In vain, too, did they look for traces of the great
kingdoms described by the early Portuguese explorers,
or of the churches and cities founded by the Europeans
in the early days of Portuguese national and Christian
enterprise. For the most part they were met only by
the dark depths of malarious mangrove swamps, and
the profound stillness and impenetrable vegetation of
the tropical forest, though here and there in the clearings
were miserable villages, inhabited by idle, good-humoured
natives, with a decided appetite for ardent
spirits&mdash;seemingly the only legacy permanently left
behind by the Europeans.</p>

<p>Pushing up the river, they at length reached the first
cataracts of the Congo, which, instead of proving to be
another Niagara, seemed to their jaundiced eyes “a
comparative brook bubbling over its stony bed”&mdash;a
description, needless to say, not confirmed by subsequent
expeditions.</p>

<p>Unable to proceed further in their boats, Tuckey and
his companions continued the exploration by land, and
in spite of the extreme difficulties they had to encounter
in cutting their way through pathless forests without a
guide, they surmounted the first stretch of falls, and
reached a point where the river widened and presented
no difficulties to navigation. Unhappily, however, the
old story of disease commenced. Three of the principal
men had successively to return to the ship; and finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
Tuckey and his companion Smith, the botanist, abandoned
their projects, seeing their further progress hopeless
in face of so many difficulties and their own helpless
condition under the paralysing influence of disease.
They reached the ship to find their three companions
dead. Smith was the next victim. Finally, overcome
by depression and mental anxiety, Captain Tuckey died
also. How many sailors succumbed we are not told.</p>

<p>Meanwhile no better luck fell to the lot of the other
section of the expedition.</p>

<p>On the 14th December, this party, consisting of 100
men and 200 animals, under the command of Major
Peddie, landed at the mouth of the Rio Nunez, nearly
midway between the Gambia and Sierra Leone. Major
Peddie’s intention was to pass across the narrow part
between the Ocean and the Niger. Hardly had he
landed, however, before the fell demon of disease, which
in its foul lair keeps watch and ward over the fair
expanse of Inner Africa, laid its invisible hand upon
him, and ere the march was begun he found a grave in
the land he had come to explore.</p>

<p>Under Captain Campbell the expedition experienced
only a succession of disasters. The donkeys rapidly
perished under the hands of men unaccustomed to look
after them. Food was only to be obtained with the
utmost difficulty, and at ruinous prices.</p>

<p>Arrived near the frontiers of the Fulah country, they
were detained for four months owing to the suspicions
entertained towards them by the king and his people.</p>

<p>Everything they had began to melt away at an alarming
rate. Soon not a beast of burden was left, and when,
seeing advance hopeless, they turned seawards, their
retreat became one continued story of plunder. Kum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>ner,
the naturalist, died <i>en route</i>, and Campbell only
reached Kakunda to add his name to the list of victims
to African exploration. The final stroke was given to
the unlucky fortunes of this evidently ill-conducted enterprise
by the death of Lieutenant Stoker, a young naval
officer who assumed command, and was about to make
a new attempt to penetrate the country.</p>

<p>Clearly African exploration was no light matter, requiring
the making of wills and the setting of earthly
affairs in order for such as put their hand to the work.
Yet strangely enough there was no halting&mdash;no dearth
of volunteers. When one died, another was ready to
take his place.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">“Each stepping where his comrade stood</div>
<div class="i0">The instant that he fell.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In this spirit Captain Gray, a survivor of Peddie’s
party, made an attempt to follow Park’s track, but got
no further than Bondou, from which, after being detained
for nearly a year, he managed to return to the
coast.</p>

<p>But what all these various disastrous attempts were
unable to achieve was meanwhile being once more accomplished
by a stay-at-home geographer, James M‘Queen.
The circumstances under which he was attracted to the
subject are in harmony with the romantic character of
African history. A copy of the narrative of Park’s first
expedition found its way into the hands of M‘Queen
while resident in the Island of Grenada, West Indies.
Among the negroes under his charge were several Mandingoes
from the banks of the Niger. One Haussa
negro he came in contact with had actually rowed Park
across the Niger.</p>

<p>Already imbued with pronounced geographical tastes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
M‘Queen’s imagination was at once taken captive by
the mystery of the Great River. With all the enthusiasm
of an ardent temperament, he devoted himself to
the solution of the question as thoroughly as Park himself,
though in a very different manner. While, one
after another, explorers toiled and struggled, sickened
and died, with but small result to science, he set about
collecting information from all the negroes and freemen he
met who had come from or even set foot in West Africa.
More especially did he study all the available materials
supplied by Arabs who had travelled and traded in the
Sudan, or by Europeans and natives who, bent on commerce
or discovery, had penetrated to the interior from
the West Coast.</p>

<p>With extraordinary genius and industry, and admirable
clear-sightedness and judgment, he set in their
true light and pieced together the various items thus
collected relating to the course of the Niger, till he
succeeded in mapping out for himself the broad geographical
features of the whole region through which
it runs. As far back as 1816 the first sketch of his
views was given to the world in a small treatise, in
which he pointed out, as had Richard before him, that
the Niger certainly entered the ocean in the Bight of
Benin. The treatise fell unheeded, however&mdash;at least
by the world at large; but undiscouraged, M‘Queen
continued his researches for five years more, and in 1821
produced a book, “Containing a Particular Account of
the Course and Termination of the Great River Niger
in the Atlantic Ocean.”</p>

<p>In this interesting work M‘Queen reviews all the
various theories respecting the Niger. He demolishes
Rennell’s opinion that it disappeared in some central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
wastes of sand, or becomes evaporated in a series of
swamps under the burning heats of a tropical sun.
The view that it flows east and joins the Nile met a
similar fate before his army of facts. The obstructing
Kong barrier was cleft asunder with a Titan’s strength,
and made to separate instead of join the Congo and
the Niger.</p>

<p>But the writer was not merely destructive. He could
build as well. With the very weapons with which he
pulled down the theories of the past, he set about constructing
a theory of his own. Laying together fact
upon fact, gathered from every available source, he
traced the course of the Niger in a southerly direction.
Bussa, from being left near Timbuktu, he transported
several hundred miles further south. From the kingdom
of Bornu and adjacent states he gathered together
the various drainage streams, and ran them into a
common channel&mdash;the Gir or Nile of the Sudan; but
instead of directing it to the true Nile, as had formerly
been the case when it was believed to be the Niger
itself, he gave it a westerly course south of the Haussa
States and Nyffé (Nupé) to its junction with the Kwora
or Main Niger. Here the Arab writers and traders
failed him, though leaving him without a doubt as to the
ultimate destination of the Central Sudanese waters.</p>

<p>For the termination, however, he had to seek information
from the Atlantic side. Everything pointed
to the Bight of Benin as the only possible place of
discharge of such a huge river. Here was found an
unknown extent of low flat country and fetid mangrove
swamp, pierced by many-branched anastomosing
creeks. From Calabar to Benin canoes could pass in all
directions by means of these creeks, and it was known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
that they extended far into the interior. Though
subject to the ebb and flow of the tide, there was no
question as to the volume of fresh water which moved
seaward, bearing floating islands on its discoloured
floods.</p>

<p>Supported by a convincing array of facts such as
these, M‘Queen could come to no other conclusion but
that “in the Bights of Benin and Biafra, therefore,
is the great outlet of the Niger, bearing along in his
majestic stream all the waters of Central Africa from
10° west longitude to 28° east longitude, and from the
Tropic of Cancer to the shores of Benin.”</p>

<p>Never was a piece of arm-chair geography worked out
more admirably. In its broad outlines it was perfectly
correct. To M‘Queen it was as much a certainty as if
he had actually explored and mapped it on the spot.</p>

<p>Imbued with this faith, he proceeded to point out the
importance of the Niger to the commerce of England
and the future of Africa. With Fernando Po and the
Niger in the hands of his countrymen, he saw Britain
mistress of the fate of the continent. Bussa was to be
the inner key of the situation. “Therefore,” he says,
“on this commanding spot let the British standard be
firmly planted, and no power on earth could tear it up....
Firmly planted in Central Africa, the British flag
would become the rallying point of all that is honourable,
useful, beneficial, just, and good. Under the mighty
shade thereof the nations would seek security, comfort,
and repose. Allies Great Britain would find in abundance.
They would flock to her settlement, if it had the power
and the means to protect them. The resources of Africa,
and the energies of Africa, under a wise and vigorous

Britain only form such a settlement, and give it that
countenance, support, and protection which the wisdom
and energy of British councils can give, and which the
power and resources of the British empire can so well
maintain, and Central Africa to future ages will remain
a grateful and obedient dependency of this empire. The
latter will become the centre of all the wealth, and the
focus of all the industry, of the former. Thus the Niger,
like the Ganges, would acknowledge Great Britain as
its protector, our king as its lord.... A city built
there under the protecting wings of Great Britain, and
extended, enriched, and embellished by the industry,
skill, and spirit of her sons, would ere long become the
capital of Africa. Fifty millions of people, yea, even a
greater number, would be dependent on it.”</p>

<p>These are brave words, truly, about what after all
was merely a “mental discovery,” and taken alone, they
might only evoke a smile, if we did not know that they
are those of a man of no ordinary genius and power of
insight. Looking back seventy years after he wrote,
we can see how truly prophetic he was in most that he
wrote, and that he was no more the blatant patriot than
the geographical dreamer. His genius for looking ahead
was as great as for looking around. Take, for instance,
his warning of the danger of a French advance from the
Senegal to the Niger, and its far-reaching consequence,
if carried out, to our commercial and political position
in West Central Africa. He it was who foresaw nearly
seventy years before its accomplishment the necessity of
a Chartered Company to take full advantage of our (then
prospective) position on the Niger, and the results that
would ensue without such a method of developing the
resources of that region. Of these matters, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
we shall treat in their proper place. Enough for the
moment if we show how thoroughly M‘Queen had made
himself master of the geographical problems then before
the public, as well as of the political and commercial
situation that was to follow the opening up of the Niger
to European intercourse. Only now, after more than
half a century of gross and irreparable mismanagement
in West Africa, we are waking up to the wisdom of his
views, and striving in some measure to carry them into
effect.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>THE TERMINATION OF THE NIGER.</i></span></h2>

<p>Unhappily for the stay-at-home geographer, no matter
how skilfully he may set forth the discoveries made in
his study, his triumph can only come after they have
been demonstrated by actual travel, and even then the
credit that falls to his share is small. The case of
M‘Queen is one in point. We have no evidence that
his theory regarding the Niger’s termination made any
special impression upon the general opinion of the
time. Unfortunately for him, too, his views were published
immediately after several disastrous attempts
from the West Coast to settle the question he had so
ably worked out, so that Government and people alike
were disposed to fight shy of the fatal region.</p>

<p>Yet with every succeeding failure the attraction of
the mysterious river seemed ever to become greater,
and a stubborn determination was evinced to break
through the deadly belt which hedged in the countries
of the interior. Conquered and rebuffed in one direction,
there was nothing for it but to try another, and
once more the Arab caravan route from Tripoli to the
Sudan was thought of. As has been elsewhere shown,
attempts in this direction had already been made by
other travellers, and all had alike failed. Of these
Horneman alone had penetrated beyond the northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
borderland of the desert, only, however, to disappear
for ever. In every other case these expeditions had
failed at the outset through fatal fevers and Oriental
obstructiveness&mdash;what, then, had the traveller to expect,
who, surmounting these initial dangers, found himself
face to face with the terrors of the great Sahara, where
nature in its fiercest aspects reigned supreme, and man
was represented only by wild roving tribes savage as
their environment.</p>

<p>Nevertheless men there were ready and eager to try
this route, as had been others before them to brave
the dangers of the West Coast.</p>

<div class="center">
<img id="i_290" src="images/i_290.png" width="451" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">CAPTAIN CLAPPERTON.</p></div>

<p>In 1820 Britain held an exceptionably favourable
position in the councils of the Court of Tripoli, while at
the same time the Basha, thanks to his guns, exercised
a very marked influence over all the Arab, Berber, and
Tibbu tribes lying between his country and the far-distant
regions of the Sudan. Hence any one starting
under the protection of the Basha had a fair guarantee
of success, provided he could withstand the possible onslaughts
of disease, and the terrible privations incidental
to desert marches.</p>

<p>Encouraged by this favourable state of matters, the
British Government determined to make another attempt
to explore by the Arab route the regions which they had
so signally failed to reach from the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Clapperton&mdash;like Park, a Scottish borderer&mdash;Dr.
Oudney, and Major Denham, were selected for the
task, and the 18th November 1821 saw them landed in
Tripoli. Little time was lost in making their preparations
and in setting forth for Murzuk in Fezzan, where
they were to make their final arrangements before
plunging into the dread Sahara. Here, though received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
kindly enough by the Sultan, they were threatened with
the system of Oriental delays which had proved fatal to
previous travellers. This, however, they were not the
men to brook, and Major Denham promptly returned
to Tripoli to lay a complaint before the Basha. As
promptly he started for England on getting nothing but
promises. This was sufficient to throw the Basha and
his Court into consternation, and vessel after vessel was
despatched to bring back the indignant traveller. They
succeeded in catching him up at Marseilles, and induced
him to return. On his arrival in Tripoli he was informed
that already his escort awaited him at Sokna,
on the borders of the Tripolitan desert.</p>

<p>Murzuk was triumphantly re-entered on the 30th
October 1822. Clapperton and Oudney were found
much reduced by the fevers, which were here so prevalent
that even amongst the natives anything like a
healthy-looking person was a rarity. To get away
from this dangerously unhealthy place, Bu Khalum,
the leader of the caravan, exerted himself with most
unoriental and praiseworthy energy, though the task
of gathering together the various elements of such a
company as his was no small matter.</p>

<p>When ready, the party consisted of four Europeans,
and servants to the number of ten, an Arab escort of
210, gathered from the most obedient tribes under the
rule of Tripoli, and a number of merchants and freed
slaves, who brought up the roll to about 300.</p>

<p>It was the 29th November before the whole party
was ready for the road. The Europeans were in no
very promising plight. They were all more or less
down with fever, and Oudney and Hillman, a carpenter,
were in a specially hopeless condition, considering what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
was before them. Nevertheless each one was eager and
determined to go on, always hoping in the future, as is
the manner of enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Almost with the disappearance of the walls, mosques,
and date-trees of Murzuk in their rear, the desert rose
up grim and terrible before them. The second day
saw them among wild wastes of burning billowy sands,
where was seen no living thing, nor other sound heard
than the melancholy sweep of the wind over the endless
tracts of sand. For some days, however, watering-places
were not unfrequent, while here and there small
oases gave a temporary relief to the monotonous landscape,
and afforded a scanty subsistence to Tibbu or
Berber inhabitants, who preferred to face the terror
of the wilderness rather than live under the harsh rule
of Arab masters. With the continued advance southward
the wells grew more scarce, and it became a matter
of congratulation when the day’s march ended beside
one. With the wells went the date-trees and the cultivated
oases, the prowling beast and the wandering
native&mdash;only a great yellow expanse perpetually unrolled
its vastness and monotony beneath the brazen canopy of
a cloudless sky.</p>

<p>Into this realm of Desolation and Death the caravan
now passed, their route marked out by the skeletons
of human beings, ominously indicative of the dangers
ahead and the horrors of the slave trade. As many
as 107 such skeletons were counted by the wayside in
a single march, and 100 were found around one well.
At some places the numbers were beyond calculation.
For days together now there was nothing but desert&mdash;hummocky
mounds, painful stone-strewn stretches of
barrenness, and shattered ribs of rock, grim, gaunt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
and terrible. The wind came like blasts from a furnace,
and from the cloudless sky the sun poured down its
burning rays in a painful flood. Under the influences
of heat, thirst, and fatigue, no word was spoken&mdash;even
the camels uttered not a groan, as if conscious of the
dire alternative to not pushing on. At times the
horses’ hoofs crunched through the bones of human
beings who had perished on the march. Night only
brought relief from the hardships of the route. Then
came the clear soothing darkness lit by a myriad stars,
the cool refreshing breezes, and the soft couch of sand,
so inexpressibly welcome to the weary, parched, and
blinded wayfarers.</p>

<p>Thus the year passed away, and 1823 was ushered in,
bringing promise of a successful issue to the enterprise.
The explorers had now reached a scantily populated
Tibbu country, where, in equal danger from drought,
famine, sandstorms, and the murderous raids and
plundering onslaughts of Berber tribes and passing
caravans, men somehow contrived to wring from the
flinty, almost arid, bosom of mother earth the wherewithal
to keep body and soul together.</p>

<p>On leaving Bilma, the chief centre of this district,
another desert tract had to be crossed, necessitating
long and harassing marches, under the hardships of
which as many as twenty camels would sink down
exhausted in a single day. This dread region was at
length also safely traversed, and infinite was the relief
and thankfulness of all when towards the end of
January the approach to more fertile tracts was indicated
by the appearance of clumps of grass, and
further on of a few scattered and stunted trees. This
miserable and dingy vegetation looked delightful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
refreshing to travellers who for over two weary months
had been in a land of death and desolation. Tibbu
inhabitants, with their flocks and herds, reappeared with
the vegetation, and fresh meat and camel’s milk were
to be had in abundance.</p>

<p>The caravan had this time reached no mere oasis.
With each day’s march south the country improved in
appearance, till the party found themselves in charming
valleys shaded by leafy trees, festooned with creeping
vines of the Colocynth, while underneath the sheltering
canopy the ground was aglow with many-hued and
brilliantly-coloured flowers. Nor was there lack of
animal life to give animation and variety to the scene.
Hundreds of twittering birds fluttered from tree to
tree, careless of the vultures and kites which gracefully
circled far up in the heavens. From a distance
shy gazelles watched the newcomers with their beautiful
eyes wide-stretched, but ready, if alarmed, to bound away
at a moment’s notice to their forest haunts. The very
sky reflected the softer conditions of nature, and showed
a brighter blue cloud-speckled; and the natives in their
smiling faces and hospitality harmonised with the happier
conditions under which they lived, though from
time to time the ruthless acts of the Arab caravan sent
them flying in terror.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the fact that the Sudan&mdash;the
country known by hearsay for over four centuries,
but which so far had baffled all attempts to explore it&mdash;had
at last been reached. On the 4th February 1823
the travellers’ eyes were greeted with a sight “so
gratifying and inspiring that it would be difficult for
language to convey an idea of its force. The great
lake Chad, glowing with the golden rays of the sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
in its strength, appeared within a mile of the spot on
which we stood. My heart bounded within me at the
prospect, for I believed this lake to be the key to the
great object of our search (presumably the Niger), and
I could not refrain from silently imploring Heaven’s
continued protection, which had enabled us to proceed
so far in health and strength even to the accomplishment
of our task.”</p>

<p>Nine days later the river Yeou was discovered flowing
from the west. The name given to it by the Arabs
unlocked the secrets of many geographical misconceptions.
But that it was neither the true Nile nor the
Niger was soon made patent&mdash;for, on the one hand, its
course ended in the Chad; and, on the other, its size,
and the reports of the natives, made it clear that it
drained only the eastern Haussa States.</p>

<p>February 17 was a momentous date in the history
of the expedition, for on that day they reached Kuka,
the capital of Bornu.</p>

<p>Their entry was made in great state, worthy the
traditions of a powerful semi-civilised Sultan. Several
thousand well equipped and marvellously caparisoned
horsemen awaited the strangers outside the town, and
on seeing them, charged as if with the intention of
annihilating the little band. Suddenly, while at full
gallop, they pulled up right in the faces of the newcomers,
almost smothering them with clouds of dust,
and putting them in some danger from the crowding
of horses and clashing of spears.</p>

<p>The Sultan’s negroes, as they were called, were specially
conspicuous, “habited in coats of mail composed of
iron chain, which covered them from the throat to the
knees, dividing behind and coming on each side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
horse. Some of them had helmets, or rather skull caps,
of the same metal, with china pieces all sufficiently
strong to ward off the shock of a spear. Their horses’
heads were also defended by plates of iron, brass, and
silver.”</p>

<p>It would be difficult to give the faintest idea of the
strange sights and scenes which now opened up before
our travellers in the centre of the ancient empire of
Bornu. Nothing more remarkable had ever been seen
by any European explorer&mdash;at least in Africa. From
the Sultan and his much-robed courtiers down to the
scantily-draped country people, all were alike interesting.
The teeming life in all its varied forms&mdash;Arab,
Berber, Fulah, and negro of twenty different tribes&mdash;made
up a picture of strange attractiveness. Not less
interesting were the curious customs, the industries, the
mixture of a considerable degree of civilisation and religious
elevation with the lowest depths of barbarism and
degrading superstition. These were the more marked,
inasmuch as when the English travellers saw Bornu
and its remarkable court, it was just re-emerging from
a temporary eclipse of its national glory. Only a short
time before it had thrown off the temporary domination
of the Fulahs, to whom it had succumbed in their first
irresistible onrush.</p>

<p>The reception of Clapperton and Denham was exceedingly
promising, and a bright career of discovery seemingly
lay open to them.</p>

<p>Matters assumed a worse aspect, however, when differences
of opinion arose among the Arabs of the
caravan. They had been despatched as an escort to
the travellers, it is true, but they were not placed
directly under their command. To do absolutely nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
but look after the safety of the Europeans was as alien
to their conception of duty as the idea of travelling all
the way to Bornu without turning the journey to profitable
account. The majority of them not being merchants,
and therefore not supplied with goods for barter,
had only their weapons to depend upon to recoup them
for their trouble. A slave raid was therefore determined
on, in spite of the opposition and remonstrances of Bu
Khalum and the Europeans. As the Arabs were not
to be turned aside from their project, the leader reluctantly
agreed to go with them, and Denham, finding
himself helpless, resolved to join the party likewise in
order to extend his knowledge of the region.</p>

<p>The mountains of Mandara, to the south of Bornu, were
chosen as the most suitable spot for a slave hunt, and
thither the raiders proceeded, accompanied by a considerable
contingent of the Bornu army.</p>

<p>Leaving Kuka in the middle of April, they reached
Mandara towards the end of the month, without any
misadventure. Here they found themselves surrounded
with mountain scenery, which could scarcely be exceeded
for beauty and richness. On all sides interminable
chains of hill closed in the view in rugged
magnificence and picturesque grandeur. Here, too,
nature revelled in its most luxuriant forms among
giant trees almost masked under the wealth of creepers
which wound around the trunks and branches, or hung
in graceful festoons swaying responsive to the passing
breeze. Native villages were everywhere to be seen
perched airily, like eagles’ nests, far up on the rocks
and mountain tops, or nestling in the valleys, hidden
like the wild deer’s lair in the depths of the forest.
Such was the lovely district into which the Arabs had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
come to bring death, ruin, and slavery. But for once
they had miscalculated their powers, or depended too
much on the co-operation of the Bornu contingent. At
the first attack the invaders drove the natives before
them, but soon they were outnumbered. Bu Khalum
was severely wounded along with the leader of the
Bornuese, and Denham received a wound in the face.
Beaten on all sides, the only safety of the survivors lay
in flight.</p>

<p>A frightful scene ensued. Denham passed through a
series of the most marvellous escapes, but at last, unhorsed
and unarmed, was seized and stripped, receiving
several wounds from spear thrusts in the process. Seeing
nothing but a cruel death before him, he resolved to
make one more effort to escape, and putting the thought
into action, he slipped below a horse, and started for the
woods, pursued by two Fulah. Reaching the shelter of
the trees, hope revived on his seeing a ravine opening
in front of him, and offering a further chance of life.
As he was on the point of letting himself down the
cliff into the stream, a puff-adder raised its head to
strike. He recoiled horror-stricken, and fell headlong
into the ravine, his fall fortunately made harmless by a
deep pool of water, where, recovering his presence of
mind, three strokes of his arms sent him to the opposite
side, and placed him in comparative safety among the
dense vegetation.</p>

<p>Shortly after, he met the remnants of the defeated
party, and six days later they re-entered Kuka, after
enduring great hardships.</p>

<p>For the next few months little of importance was
done to elucidate the geography of the Chad Region.
An expedition westward to Manga was accomplished with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
less disastrous results than that to the Mandara mountains;
and then the rainy season set in, threatening for
a time to end the days of the European travellers by the
fevers which accompanied it. With the return of the
dry season came renewed health and renewed determination
to add further to their discoveries.</p>

<p>On the 14th December, Clapperton and Oudney set
forth to visit Kano and the Haussa States in the company
of a trading caravan.</p>

<p>Two days later a Mr. Toole arrived at Kuka with
fresh supplies for the expedition, at a moment when
they were much needed.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the year 1824 Denham and Toole
started for the district of Logun with the object of visiting
the Shari River. The project was safely accomplished,
and they found a majestic river 400 yards
broad, flowing from the south and south-west into the
Chad.</p>

<p>The difficulty of obtaining correct geographical information
from the natives was well illustrated in their
case, it being clear that they confounded with the Shari
a great river (the Benué) they heard of as flowing <i>from</i>
the south and south-west of Mandara, whereas in reality
the latter flows <i>to</i> the west. It is extremely probable,
however, that some sort of connection exists between
them in the wet season.</p>

<p>At Logun Mr. Toole died.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Clapperton and Oudney were travelling
towards Kano, and giving shape and form to the confused
and conflicting accounts over which geographers
had quarrelled for a couple of centuries. Unfortunately
on this journey, Oudney, who had never enjoyed good
health from the day he left Tripoli, gradually became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
worse, and died on the 12th January 1824. Left to
himself, Clapperton passed on to Kano, which he found
to be a town of 30,000 to 40,000 inhabitants, and chiefly
important as a trading and industrial centre, it being
famed as such from the most remote times.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="caption">VIEW IN SOKOTO.</p></div>

<p>On the 16th of March he reached Sokoto, the capital
of the new Fulah Empire, and there was hospitably
received by Bello, son and successor of the founder.
From Sokoto he hoped to make his way to Yauri and
Nupé, to clear up as far as possible the question of the
course of the Niger. At first everything looked favourable
for his plans, but gradually his hopes vanished, as
every one set about dissuading him from attempting the
journey.</p>

<p>At last the Sultan himself withdrew his promise of
protection, on the plea of excessive danger to his guest.
In the face of such a decided veto it was useless to
attempt to proceed, though for several weary weeks
Clapperton waited on in the hope that something would
turn up which would open a way for him. No change
for the better occurred, however, and at length he took
leave of Sultan Bello, and returned to Bornu.</p>

<p>On September 3rd a caravan having been got together,
the homeward journey was commenced.</p>

<p>In the course of the next four months the Sahara
was safely recrossed, and Tripoli re-entered on the 26th
January, the travellers having been absent nearly three
years on their arduous undertaking.</p>

<p>This must be considered the most successful African
expedition up to that period&mdash;successful alike in its
scientific results and in the extent of country explored
for the first time. Once for all it settled the question
as to the direction in which the mouth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
Niger must be looked for. Certainly it neither flowed
east, nor did it end in any known desert or lake. Yet
curiously enough, to judge from the travellers’ maps,
they were still some way behind M‘Queen in their
knowledge of the general geography of the great eastern
tributary of the Niger. Through a misunderstanding
on Clapperton’s part as to the direction of the Benué,
the River Shari was represented as draining its waters
from the west instead of from the south and east. But
perhaps the most valuable result of the expedition was,
that for the first time form and coherence were given
to the geography of the Arab writers and traders, and
exact information collected regarding the remarkable
kingdoms forming the Central Sudan.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>THE TERMINATION OF THE NIGER&mdash;(Continued).</i></span></h2>

<p>Among the many valuable results arising from Clapperton
and Denham’s expedition, not the least important
was the great encouragement it gave to renewed enterprise.
With the successes of these two explorers the
tide of evil fortune seemed to have turned, and they
had shown that death or failure did not necessarily
meet whomsoever had the temerity to seek to unlock
the secrets of Ethiopia.</p>

<p>Clapperton, moreover, had brought back with him
from Sokoto the most friendly messages from Bello,
the Sultan, expressive of his desire for direct intercourse
with the British, and pointing out how that
intercourse might best be established by way of the
Niger and the West Coast, to which, he asserted, his
dominions extended. To take advantage of this more
hopeful state of affairs, the British Government organised
another expedition, once more with the object of settling
the vexed question of the Niger termination, and at the
same time opening up a way to the rich provinces of
Sokoto, Bornu, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Clapperton was again selected as leader, and with him
were associated Captain Pearce and Surgeon Morrison.</p>

<p>The Gulf of Benin was chosen as the landing point,
the reason being that there they hoped to find the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
entrance to the river and follow it to Bussa. On their
arrival, however, it was deemed advisable not to lose
time and health among the interminable creeks and
fatal mangrove swamps known to distinguish the probable
delta of the Niger. It was known that Haussa
caravans were in the habit of annually descending
overland to the coast at Badagry, a point a few miles
to the west of what is now known as Lagos. With
much wisdom and common sense Clapperton and his
companions therefore elected to penetrate to the Niger
by this route, and after completing their business with
Sokoto, to descend the river in canoes.</p>

<p>On the 7th December 1825 the party left the coast.
Hardly, however, had they got beyond earshot of the
Atlantic rollers, when it seemed as if the fate which had
befallen so many earlier ventures was about to overtake
Clapperton’s also. Through imprudently sleeping
in the open air, they were all attacked by fever.
Undismayed and unsubdued, they nevertheless pushed
on, staggering forward as best they might. But there
were limits to their defiance of disease. Morrison gave
in first, and turning to retrace his way to the coast, died
on the road. Captain Pearce was the next victim, and
he, like the soldier who falls in battle with his face
to the foe, dropped on the road, struggling onward to
the last.</p>

<p>Though now deprived of both his friends, Clapperton
was not yet absolutely alone. He had with him an
English servant named Richard Lander, who, with a
spirit worthy of such a master, faced all the perils and
hardships of the route. Happily, however, by the end
of the month the deadly coast belt was safely passed,
and healthier lands lay before them. They entered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
populous country of Yoruba, with its teeming population,
its well cultivated fields, enormous towns, and general
air of prosperity. Through Yoruba they passed in a
semi-triumphal procession, with no greater trouble to
face than the anxiety of the king to keep the white
men in his own capital, or the siren wiles of the widow
Zuma, who, with her colossal charms, sought to woo
them from the path of danger and toil to the flower-strewn
haunts of love and ease. Heedless alike, however,
of kingly favours and full-fed charms&mdash;the widow
being fat and twenty&mdash;Clapperton held on his way, as
also did Lander, who was as little to be seduced from
his master’s side as his master from the path of duty.</p>

<p>Clapperton had hoped to reach the Niger at Nupé,
but news of war and bloodshed in that region caused
him to deviate from his intended route and strike the
great river somewhat higher up. As the fates would
have it, he reached the Niger at the very point where
Park had ended at once his voyage and his career.
Clapperton’s reception seemed to belie the story of Amadi
Fatuma as to the manner of Park’s death, but a little
investigation proved beyond a doubt the truth of its
chief particulars. The natives had attacked him under
a misconception as to his nationality, and every one
spoke with regret of the unhappy catastrophe. The
place was pointed out where the boat and crew were
lost.</p>

<p>At this point the river is divided into three channels,
none more than twenty yards broad when the water is
low. The left branch is the only safe one for canoes,
the other two being broken up by rocks into dangerous
whirlpools and rapids. Bussa itself stands on an island
about three miles long by one and a half broad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>From Bussa, Clapperton passed through Nupé and
across the Haussa States to Kano. Thence he proceeded
to join Bello at Sokoto. He arrived, however,
at an unfortunate time. Civil war and rebellion were
rife on all hands, and it seemed as if the great Fulah
Empire was about to fall to pieces as quickly as it had
been built up. Bello, in consequence, was in a fit state
to listen to all sorts of insinuations as to the causes
which brought the Europeans into his country, and the
results that were likely to follow. Accordingly, Clapperton’s
reception was anything but friendly, and under
the worries consequent on his treatment, and the fevers
by which he was attacked, he at length succumbed on
the 13th April 1827.</p>

<p>Of the members of the expedition there now remained
only Richard Lander, who had attached himself to Clapperton
with such remarkable fidelity. Three courses
were open to him&mdash;to return to England by way of the
desert and Tripoli, to go back by the way he had come,
or thirdly, to attempt to carry out his late master’s
intention of tracing the Niger to its mouth. Lander
was a man of no ordinary intelligence and character,
notwithstanding his subordinate position in life, and as
if Clapperton’s mantle had fallen on him, he elected to
do what he could to complete the unfinished work.</p>

<p>With this object in view he returned to Kano from
Sokoto, and thence started south to reach the Niger,
being under the belief that the great river in that direction
was the object of his search&mdash;while in reality it was
another.</p>

<p>In this, however, he failed. He had almost reached
the great town of Yakoba, when his progress was
stopped, and he was compelled to return to Kano.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
Thence he made his way back as he had come through
Yoruba to Badagry, which he reached on the 21st
November 1827.</p>

<p>The unhappy issue of Clapperton’s second expedition
somewhat chilled African enterprise for the time being.
Our knowledge of the course and termination of the
Niger was left exactly where it had been before&mdash;though
it was made more and more clear that from Bussa it
flowed south to Benin. Still the river seemed to lie
under some charm fatal to whomsoever should brave it
and seek to lift the veil.</p>

<p>The Government began to lose hope, or to conclude that
the deadly nature of the climate rendered the discovery
of the mouth of the Niger one only of geographical importance.
But though they wavered and felt disposed
to give up the task, there were still plenty of volunteers
eager to make one more attempt.</p>

<p>No matter what the dangers were, Africa had a strange
power of fascination which irresistibly drew men under
its influence; not those merely who had never set foot
on its deadly shore, and who consequently could not fully
realise all that travel in Africa meant, but men who had
seen their companions die beside them on the road,
struck down by disease or the weapon of the savage,
and who had themselves known what it was to be at
death’s door. It is a species of mesmeric influence this
of African travel, irresistibly compelling him who has
once come beneath its spell to return again and again,
even though at last it be to his death.</p>

<p>Lander was no exception to the rule. He went out
to Africa knowing nothing, and probably caring less, for
the objects of his master’s expedition. But he was of
the right sort to come beneath the fatal charm; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
with the death of his master he felt himself consecrated
to the work of exploration. In this spirit he returned
to England with Clapperton’s journal, only to offer himself
for one more effort to complete the task the death
of the writer had left unfinished. Such an offer the
Government could not very well refuse, though the
terms promised by them showed that they had but
little faith in a favourable outcome.</p>

<p class="caption">RICHARD LANDER.</p></div>

<p>But Lander was no longer the servant. African
travel had ennobled him and placed him in the roll of
her knight-errantry. He knew no sordid motives, asked
no pay or other remuneration. Success should be his
only reward. His enthusiasm infected his brother John
with a like spirit, and caused him to throw in his fortunes
with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>The 22nd March 1830 saw the gallant fellows landed
at Badagry. They followed practically the same route
as Clapperton’s expedition to Eyeo, from which they
were compelled to take a circuitous northerly course to
the Niger at Bussa, which they reached in three months
from the coast.</p>

<p>After having paid a visit to the King of Yauri some
distance up the river, preparations were commenced for
the voyage down to the ocean. With difficulty two
canoes were obtained, but at length, on the 20th September,
everything was ready for departure. Before
pushing clear of the land, the Landers “humbly thanked
the Almighty for past deliverances, and fervently prayed
that He would always be with us and crown our enterprise
with success.” Having thus placed themselves
under Divine protection, the word was given to push
off, and away the canoes glided towards their uncertain
bourne.</p>

<p>The first part of the voyage lay through a narrow
valley bounded by metamorphic hills, through which the
river wound its way in broad curving reaches, broken
up at times by inhabited islands, which rose precipitously
from the dark waters, and gave variety to the
scene. Majestic trees lined the banks, and lent their
own peculiar charm to the panoramic landscape, while
village and cultivated field spoke of industrious inhabitants.
From the latter they had nothing to fear&mdash;on
the contrary, the travellers were everywhere received
hospitably, and sent on their way with prayers for
their safety and food for their wants. A more instant
danger lay in the numerous rocks which thrust their
crests above the water, or more treacherously lay hid
beneath, requiring constant watchfulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon this rocky section was passed, and the district
of Nupé entered.</p>

<p>Here the river, emerging from the metamorphic hills,
turns eastward and widens, flowing through a broad
valley whose precipitous sides form the escarpments of
a low sandstone plateau-land. This section is scantily
inhabited and sparsely wooded, on account of the fact
that while the river is in flood, the great plains which
form the bottom of the valley are submerged, and the
river assumes the aspect of a lake.</p>

<p>Sixty miles further down is a picturesque range of
mountains&mdash;now called Rennell’s&mdash;shortly after passing
which comes the town of Egga. From thence the
broad valley begins to narrow, and the river to wind
in sharp curves through the low sandstone gorges, till,
turning sharply to the south, it enters a lake-like expanse,
where the Landers found that a large tributary
from the east, which they conjectured to be the Tchadda
or Benué, joined the main stream. This was the river
which Clapperton had confounded with the Shari,
though M‘Queen had worked out its true relationship
to the Niger system.</p>

<p>Immediately beyond the point of junction, the Niger
leaves the sandstone plateau and passes through a series
of bold picturesque mountains by a narrow gorge, guarded
on either side by isolated peaks and table-topped mountains,
which frown over the waters in defiant, barren ruggedness.
As if to stop all ingress or egress, small islands
and hidden rocks rise in mid-stream, round which the swift
currents of the contracted river angrily sweep and swirl.</p>

<p>This natural gateway passed, the river expands again
into majestic reaches, sunning its full bosom under the
tropic sun, unbroken by rock or island. The mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
fall into gentle undulations, and these again into a
limitless, flat expanse, but little raised above the level
of the river. With every mile the vegetation grows
more and more luxuriant, more and more prodigal, till
the primeval forest lies before the traveller in all its
height and depth and solemnity. Never before had the
brothers Lander seen such trees, such a profusion of
shrubs, such a tangle of varied creepers.</p>

<p>Here and there villages, charmingly adorned with nodding
palms, peeped cosily from their bosky corners in the
dark protecting forest. Near the houses stood or lolled
groups of scantily clothed natives, passing the lazy
hours away in dreamy idleness, as became the lords of
creation. Children, naked as the day they were born,
gambolled in the river like frogs; and women, ever
at work, busied themselves with domestic cares. At
some places battle had been given to the rank luxuriance
of nature, and small clearings made in the forest
for the raising of yams, beans, or sugar-canes.</p>

<p>Not least inviting in the scene was the Niger itself.
Now it spread before the voyagers like a beautiful lake,
ringed with fringing festooned trees, and flashing brilliantly
under the rays of the tropic sun. Again, far
ahead, the forest frame opened and displayed the serpentine
course of the silvery river, edged with yellow banks of
sand. Canoes were seen gliding swiftly down stream,
or with more laborious paddling were forced upward
against the current. On the banks left by the falling
waters, crocodiles disposed their repulsive length like
rotting logs of wood, while in the deeper pools the
hippos snorted defiance. Waterfowl in great numbers
skimmed along the surface of the water, fished in the
shallows, or rested on <i>terra firma</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>The scene was arcadian and fascinating seen from the
river. A closer acquaintance did not enhance its attractiveness.
The voyagers were now among a people far
different from those above the confluence of the Niger
and the Benué (Tchadda). Here were only Pagan
savages, steeped in the lowest barbarism, and ruled by
the grossest superstition. Murder and plunder were in
congenial union with fetishism and cannibalism, and
hospitality was unknown. Only by force could Lander
get his men to venture into this dangerous region.
That their fears were not mere fancies was speedily
proved on the very first occasion of landing, and again
later on they only escaped utter destruction, to fall into
semi-captivity to a party of men in large canoes who
were up river ready to trade with the strong, and to
attack and plunder the weak.</p>

<p>The travellers now found themselves among people
who came from near the sea, and who had not only heard
of, but had actually traded with Europeans. It was
therefore in no despondent mood that they submitted
to their fate, and proceeded on their way, the captives
of the Ibo.</p>

<p>Soon it was clear that the delta of the river had been
reached. From being a united volume of water it began
to break up into numerous branches, running in all
directions. At the apex of the delta the land was dry,
and clad with palm oil groves and silk cotton trees.
Gradually, however, these disappeared, and as the dry
land gave place to hybrid swamp, the mangrove asserted
its ownership. Nature then showed as repulsive an
aspect as is to be met with in any other region on the
face of the globe&mdash;what was swamp when the tide was
out resembling a submerged forest when the tide was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
in, and both then and at all other times, reeking with
pestilential vapours from the slimy mud oozing from
between the octopus-like roots of the mangrove.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="caption">AKASSA.</p></div>

<p>In passing through this foul region the travellers had
little reason to wonder that no one had ever ventured
to explore the labyrinthine creeks and river branches
which penetrated the mangrove in all directions, but
seemed to lead to nowhere in particular.</p>

<p>On the 24th November 1830 the dull thunder of the
Atlantic rollers breaking on the shore came like sweetest
music to the travellers’ ears, growling a gruff but hearty
welcome, and soon the sea itself lay before them&mdash;its
cool healthy breezes fanning them with delicious touch,
its gleaming limitless expanse fair as a glimpse of
heaven.</p>

<p>The Niger mystery was solved at last, and the river
portals thrown wide open to the world, never again to
be closed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>FILLING UP THE DETAILS.</i></span></h2>

<p>While Clapperton and Lander were thus bringing the
work of Park to a successful conclusion, and proving
the accuracy of M‘Queen’s geography of the Niger basin,
there were others at work in the region which the
labours and death of their great pioneer had made
classic ground. Major Laing, in the course of a Government
mission, had travelled from Sierra Leone to Falaba,
in the country of Sulima, and ascertained that the Niger
took its rise in the Highlands of Kurauka, some 70
miles south-west of Falaba, and not more than 150
miles east of Sierra Leone. The river itself he was prevented
from reaching, but none the less did he come
under the irresistible influence of its fascination.</p>

<p>More than ever had Timbuktu and the Niger become
names to conjure with, as well as to infect men with a
species of reckless self-sacrifice that no amount of past
experience, prudence, or common sense could dispel. As
in the case of Lander, and others of his predecessors,
having once tasted the bitter-sweet of African exploration,
there could be no rest for Major Laing until he
had gathered again the magic fruit. Accordingly, after
an interval of three years, he once more set forth, determined
to carry his cherished dreams into realisation.</p>

<p>Timbuktu and the Upper Niger were the goals of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
journey. Like Denham and Clapperton, he took Tripoli
as his starting-point. Thence he passed south-west to
Ghadamis and the oasis of Twat. Between the latter
and Timbuktu lay the wild wastes of the Sahara&mdash;never
trodden by man without extreme risk of encounter
with plunder and bloodshed-loving nomads, and death
from thirst or privation. Even these factors of an
African journey had their wild attraction for men of
Laing’s temperament, adding a <i>sauce piquante</i>, as it were,
to the otherwise monotonous march and daily routine
of worry and privation. To such, too, the frowning
immensity of the Sahara&mdash;the frightful desolation
which marks its every feature&mdash;and the flaming sun
and lurid heavens that hang above it, have elements
which strike them with the profoundest feelings of awe,
and leave an indelible impress on their minds.</p>

<p>For sixteen days after leaving Twat, Laing underwent
all these sensations in their most striking form;
and that his experiences of desert travel might be complete,
he was attacked at night by a party of Tuareg
marauders, and left for dead, with no less than twenty-four
wounds. Thanks, however, to the secret elixir of
heroic minds and the soundness of his constitution, he
miraculously recovered, and undismayed, continued his
way to Timbuktu, which was reached on the 18th August
1826.</p>

<p>Laing was the first European who had ever entered
that historic city, which for four centuries had been
the loadstone of kings, merchants, and savants. He
arrived in an unhappy hour. Only a short time before
the first waves of the approaching tide of Fulah influence
had entered the region of the Upper Niger.
Already Timbuktu had felt its strange power, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
resenting the political position usurped by the ministers
of the new revival.</p>

<p>For a month Laing was allowed to remain unmolested.
Then he was ordered to leave the city of the
Faithful. There was no resisting the mandate, and he
passed forth on the 22nd September, only to be foully
murdered two days later by the people who had undertaken
to escort him across the desert. With him
unfortunately perished the records of his observations
and inquiries.</p>

<p>Two years later, Caillé, a somewhat illiterate, though
persevering and intrepid Frenchman, entered the city
from which Laing had been driven forth. Years before,
this young explorer, in his far-off French home, had
heard the echoes of African enterprise. Inflamed with
the romantic story, he had seen by the blank maps of
the continent how much there was to be done, and what
fame there was to be acquired by him who could make
his mark on those still virgin sheets. To be an African
traveller became thenceforth the object of his life. For
years he dreamed of and prepared himself for the work.
But it was one thing to dream of&mdash;one thing even to
reach the threshold of new lands&mdash;and quite another to
penetrate them, as he soon found. Time after time
his hopes, when almost at the point of realisation, were
rudely dashed to the ground; but uncrushed, he waited
his time and opportunity, though without private means,
and conscious that the ears of the wealthy and the powerful
were deaf to his schemes and representations.</p>

<p>But while Caillé dreamed and petitioned he also
worked. As a subordinate official under the Government
of Sierra Leone, he was enabled by dint of economy and
industry to save the sum of £80. To him this slender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
sum appeared the “open sesame” of fame and fortune.
It was the instrument whereby he should open the
oyster shell, and gain the priceless pearl within.</p>

<p>On the 19th April 1827, Caillé left Kakundy, on the
River Nunez, and midway between Sierra Leone and the
Gambia, in the company of a small caravan of Mandingoes.
Travelling east, he crossed the country of
Futa Jallon, through which northward ran the upper
tributaries of the Senegal, and eastward those of the
Niger. The latter river was reached at Kurusa, in
the district of Kankan, and was found to be even there
a fine stream from eight to ten feet deep.</p>

<p>Having crossed the Niger, he continued east to the
country of Wasulu, a well cultivated and thickly inhabited
region. Thence he travelled north-east, till at
length he again reached the banks of the Niger, a short
distance to the west of Jenné. This town he was the
first European to enter, though Park had seen it on his
last journey.</p>

<p>From Jenné, Caillé sailed down the Niger in a rudely
built vessel of considerable dimensions to Kabara, the
port of Timbuktu, whence he proceeded on horseback
to the city itself.</p>

<p>The aspect of Timbuktu in nowise realised the glowing
anticipations of the traveller. Instead of the wealthy
and powerful city, touched with the glamour of the
shining orient, which he had been taught to expect,
there lay before him only a collection of miserable mud
buildings, among which rose several mosques, looking
imposing only in comparison with the rude huts
around them. To the north-east and south spread the
immensity of the great desert as one vast plain of
burning, repellent sands, over which the silence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
death brooded, except where pariah dogs or loathsome
vultures feasted on the carrion or offal thrown out of
the town. Such was the place in which Commerce had
established her Central African emporium, and gathered
together the trading veins and arteries which ramified
more or less throughout the whole of North-eastern
Africa. Here, too, amid these dreary wastes, Moslem
learning had made her seat; and here the religion of
Islam had found an abiding centre from which to radiate
its influence into the most barbarous depths of negro
Africa.</p>

<p>Seen thus in relation to its surroundings, its position,
and its functions, the mud huts and rudely built mosques
which compose it acquire a tinge of the sublime, and
strike the imagination more even than the stupendous
wonders of a London or a Paris.</p>

<p>For a fortnight Caillé&mdash;secure in his disguise&mdash;remained
in Timbuktu, after which he set forth with a
caravan to cross the desert to Morocco. Along no
other part of the Sahara does the desert appear in
such a terror-striking aspect. Through one tract the
caravan had to travel with all possible expedition for
ten days, not a drop of water being obtainable. The
privations endured were indescribable, men and animals
alike being reduced to the direst extremity before water
was reached and their tortures assuaged. Further north
similar experiences awaited them, till the caravan arrived
at the River Dra. Thence the march was performed
with comparative comfort by way of Tafilet and the
Atlas to Fez and Tangier, where Caillé arrived on the
18th August 1828.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="caption">TIMBUKTU.</p></div>

<p>With Lander’s descent of the Niger from Bussa to
the sea, the course of Niger enterprise received a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
new development and impetus. The glowing accounts
brought back by its explorers of the rich lands and
powerful civilised kingdoms through which it flowed
found eager hearers in England; and now that an
entrance had been found by which the heart of these
promising regions could be reached, such hearers were
not slow to act and test in a practical fashion the commercial
value of the great waterway.</p>

<p>In this new movement Macgregor Laird, of Liverpool,
was the leading spirit. Under his instructions two
steamers were specially constructed for the work. Laird
himself took command, and with him were associated
Lander, and Lieutenant Allen of the navy, with Dr.
Briggs and Mr. Oldfield as medical attendants.</p>

<p>Hardly had the party entered the Nun branch of the
river, in August 1832, when the malaria commenced its
ravages, causing the death of a captain and two seamen.
The first business of the expedition was to find a suitable
navigable channel among the many bewildering branches,
creeks, and backwaters which spread a labyrinthine
network over the delta, whose mangrove swamps were
“uninviting when descried, repulsive when approached,
dangerous when examined, and horrible and loathsome
when their qualities and their inhabitants were known.”
Here the air reeked with the essence of poisonous odours&mdash;damp,
clammy, and deadly; and the nights were made
hideous by the never-ceasing attacks of clouds of mosquitoes
and sandflies.</p>

<div class="center">
<img id="i_326" src="images/i_326.png" width="600" height="177" alt="" />
<p class="caption">VIEW OF THE NIGER ABOVE LOKOJA.</p></div>

<p>For six weeks Laird was engaged in his exploration
of the delta, with the result that eighteen men succumbed
to fever. For a time the expedition threatened
to end in the death of the entire party, hardly one
escaping the dire effects of the malaria. But Laird and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
his companions were men not easily discouraged or defeated,
and at length they got away from the deadly
area, and reached the undivided
river and healthier
upper regions. It was like
an escape from a loathsome
purgatory to an earthly
paradise, when the party
sailed into the open reaches
of the noble stream, barred
in by tropic forest and
swept by cooling breezes.
Viewed commercially,however,
the prospect proved
somewhat unsatisfactory,
and did not correspond
with the glowing hopes
with which the party had
left England. There was
no thought, however, of
giving way to the first
feeling of disappointment,
and in the belief that
matters would improve
once beyond the barbarous
zone, they continued
their way up the river.
Unfortunately, they had
chosen the wrong time of
the year to make the ascent.
Already the river
was falling. More than once the larger of the two
steamers grounded on sand-banks, and finally had to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
laid up till the rising of the waters should set in once
more. Attempts to reach Rabba signally failed, though
Laird ascended the Benué some distance in a boat.</p>

<p>In the following season Oldfield and Lander were
more successful. The Benué was ascended to a distance
of 104 miles before they were compelled to return from
want of supplies. On the Main Niger they were also
more fortunate than in the previous year. Rabba was
safely reached, and found to contain a population little
short of 40,000, being at that time the capital of Nupé.</p>

<p>Beyond Rabba it was found impossible to proceed,
and it was deemed advisable to return to the coast, to
recruit and prepare for another attempt to establish a
trade in the river.</p>

<p>This new venture, however, ended in disaster. On
the way back Lander was shot, and was only kept alive
till Fernando Po was reached. With him ended for
the time being Macgregor Laird’s enterprise. Though
carried out with splendid persistence and self-sacrifice,
its results were sadly negative, while out of the forty-nine
Europeans who had been engaged in it only nine
survived the fevers.</p>

<p>For several years nothing more was done to turn what
was only too well named “the white man’s grave” to
further account. In 1840, however, Governor Beecroft
ascended the river to within thirty miles of Bussa, and
got back without much loss of life, though adding but
little to our knowledge of the geography of the region.</p>

<p>Meanwhile philanthropists were as much interested
in the opening up of the Niger basin to European
influence as was the commercial world. Laird’s expedition,
though having trade as its primary object,
“hoped also to aid in suppressing the slave trade, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
introducing true religion, civilisation, and humanising
influences among natives whose barbarism had hitherto
been only heightened by European connection.”</p>

<p>These unselfish aims were further emphasised in 1841,
when the Government, still undaunted by the fatal character
of the work, sent out three steamers with the object
of making treaties with the Niger chiefs for the suppression
of the slave trade. A model farm was to be established
at the confluence of the Benué and the main
river, to teach the natives better methods of agriculture,
and generally the foundations were to be laid of the
great British Empire of which M‘Queen had dreamed.
Thus, in some small way, expiation was to be made
for the sins of earlier generations. Everything that
science and forethought could suggest was done to make
this expedition a success, but unhappily no way had
yet been found to ward off the insidious attacks of
malaria, or counteract the effects of the fever germs once
they had gained a footing in the system. The result
was death and disaster. No higher point than Egga
was reached, and that only by one steamer. Out of
one hundred and forty-five men, forty-eight died within
the two months the vessels were in the river.</p>

<p>The project of turning the Niger to profitable account,
in the face of such frightful mortality and deadly climatic
conditions, seemed now to be utterly hopeless. From
Major Houghton downwards, death by violence, privation,
or disease had been the fate of whoever had
attempted to open it up to European influence. No
other river had such a romantic history of heroic self-sacrifice&mdash;none
such a martyr roll&mdash;none such a record of
heroism and precious blood apparently uselessly thrown
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>Was it really all in vain? Was neither the European
nor the native to derive any benefit from the
exploration of this silvery streak through the beautiful
West Coast Highlands, the densely populated plains of
Sego and Massina, the depopulated half desert wilderness
of Songhay and Gandu, the forest depths of Igara
and Ado, and the mangrove swamps around the Bight
of Benin. Were Park, Clapperton, Lander, and all the
other explorers of the Niger basin, only to be remembered
in future ages for the heroic virtues they had
shown, and not as the pioneers of a new era of hope
to the African&mdash;the founders of a great national
enterprise, bright with promise alike to Britain and to
Africa?</p>

<p>The thought of such an ending was not to be entertained
without reluctance, yet it seemed inevitable.
Savage opposition and ordinary physical difficulties
might in time be overcome, but who could fight
against the disease which lurked unseen in the fœtid
depths of mangrove forests, and filled the air with its
poisonous germs? Who could avoid the incurable
blight of its deadly breath?</p>

<p>Already such questions had been asked, when the
failure of Tuckey’s expedition gave pause for a time
to Niger exploration, till Clapperton and Denham,
attacking the region from the rear, had made the despondent
once more hopeful. Strangely enough, the
recurrence of the same crisis brought with it a similar
cure.</p>

<p>In 1849 an expedition set forth from Tripoli, under
Government auspices this time, commanded by Richardson,
and Drs. Barth and Overweg.</p>

<p>The frontiers of Bornu were safely reached, and here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
the party divided&mdash;never to meet again. Richardson
and Overweg went the way of Toole and Oudney, and
only Barth was left to carry out the objects of the
expedition. Right worthily he performed his task.
Never before had such a rich harvest of geographical,
historical, ethnographical, and philological facts been
gathered in the African field of research.</p>

<p>From Kanem to Timbuktu, from Tripoli to Adamawa,
he laid the land under contribution. Vain would it be
in the restricted space of these pages to follow him in
his wonderful travels. It may be noted, however, that
while travelling south-west from Kuka in Bornu to the
Fulah province of Adamawa, he reached on the 18th
June 1851 the river Benué, at its junction with the
Faro, and 415 geographical miles in a direct line from
its confluence with the Niger. Not since leaving
Europe had he seen so large and imposing a river.
Even at this distant point the Benué, or “Mother of
Waters,” is half a mile broad, and runs with a swift current
to the west. It was said to rise nine days’ journey
to the south-east, while the Faro came from a mountain
seven days’ journey distant.</p>

<p>Only second in importance to his discovery of the
Benué so far to the east of the Niger, was his exploration
of the great bend of the Niger itself.</p>

<p>Travelling from Bornu, he passed west through
Sokoto and Gandu to the Niger at Say, some distance
above the point where the Gulbi-n-Gindi from Sokoto
joins the main river.</p>

<p>From Say he travelled in a north-easterly direction
across the great bend, among wild Tuareg tribes, and
the romantic mountains of Hombori, to Timbuktu.
Thence he once more returned to the safer Haussa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
States along the river banks, whereon no European eye
save Park’s had ever before rested. Here he was in the
centre of the once wonderful Songhay Empire, of which
the sole relics left after the destructive blows of Moor,
Tuareg, and Fulah, were a few miserable villages, whose
inhabitants eked out a wretched existence, equally
ground down by drought and the ravages of human
marauders.</p>

<p>One result of Barth’s discovery of the Benué so near
Lake Chad was the despatch of another expedition, to
determine if possible the navigability of the river, a
point which previous attempts had failed to settle satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Macgregor Laird was again the leading spirit in this
new enterprise, and anything that past experience could
suggest was taken advantage of to ensure a successful
trip. Dr. Baikie, R.N., and D. J. May, R.N., went as
surveying officers and leaders, several other gentlemen
being associated with them. This in some respects was
the most successful of the Government surveying expeditions,
for it not only explored and surveyed the Benué
for a distance of 340 miles, but returned without any
special loss of life.</p>

<p>With this trip practically closed our Government’s
participation in the work of opening up the Niger.
Thenceforth it contented itself with sending from time
to time a gunboat into the river on some punitive mission,
but no special attempts were made to further enlighten
the world as to its geography and resources.
Henceforth all such work was left to private enterprise,
Government remaining aloof, disposed neither
to encourage nor discourage, but clearly satisfied that
nothing of importance could be made of a partially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
navigable river, flowing through a country of seemingly
no great commercial capabilities, and with a climate
which made colonisation out of the question, and even
a residence, however short, almost impossible to the
average European.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>THE FRENCH ADVANCE TO THE NIGER.</i></span></h2>

<p>With the practical withdrawal of our Government
from Niger enterprise, M‘Queen’s magnificent dream
of British Empire in the heart of Africa seemingly
vanished for ever. A new school of politicians appeared
in our national councils who had so little read
the secrets of our country’s greatness, that their cry
was for no more foreign expansion&mdash;no more colonial
responsibilities.</p>

<p>The influence of the retrograde movement soon began
to tell on the fortunes of West Africa. Already its
natural development had been retarded by a deadly
climate, a scarcity of valuable products, and the barbarity
and laziness of its inhabitants. To these were
now added Government neglect and mismanagement.
Administrators and governors were told to restrict their
operations to the narrowest limits. Merchants were
either debarred access to the interior, or informed that
they would advance at their own risk, and with no hope
of Government support. Geographical enterprise shared
in the general blight. The work of exploring a region
which had become classic through the travels and
martyred lives of so many of Britain’s most worthy
sons was stopped.</p>

<p>Needless to say, such a policy led to disgraceful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
results. British influence was confined to the coast
region, there to eke out a miserable political and
commercial existence among its deadly swamps; our
governors were given the old woman’s task of administering
ludicrously unsuitable laws, or palavering over
petty disputes with still more petty tribal chiefs; our
merchants, thanks to the conditions under which they
were placed, became degraded into barterers of gin, rum,
tobacco, gunpowder, and guns, the best Europe had to
give in return for Africa’s oils, gold, and ivory. But
while we were thus degenerating into an invertebrate
abortion of British colonial genius, fit occupant of slimy
swamps and fever-breeding jungles, a continental rival
was preparing to step into our shoes, and reap the
reward of our former labours.</p>

<p>Almost coincidently with the practical throwing up
of our work on the Lower Niger, the French began
to bestir themselves on the Senegal, and cast longing
eyes towards Bambarra and the Upper Niger. They
too began to dream of Central African Empire&mdash;as
once M‘Queen had done&mdash;and to see far off in the
future their flag supreme from the Mediterranean
coast line of Algiers to the shores of the Atlantic.
The key of the situation they clearly saw lay in the
Niger. Once established there, with the necessary
openings to the west, they would have command of
the whole of the Western Sudan, and possibly also of
the Central Region.</p>

<p>With patient foresight they began to send explorers
along the line of proposed conquest, carrying with them
ready-made treaties, French flags, and blank maps.
Already French influence had made itself felt far up
the river, and forts had been established in the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
earliest days of their rule. Such of the latter as had
fallen into ruins or had been deserted were once more
occupied and repaired, and new advance posts were
pushed further into the heart of the country.</p>

<p>Soon they had firmly established themselves as high
up the Senegal as the point where Park in his first
expedition had crossed it on his way to Kaarta. This
was the limit of the river’s navigability in the wet
season. But no consideration of natural difficulties
gave limit to their dream of power.</p>

<p>In 1863, two officers, E. Mage and Dr. Quintin,
prospected a way to the Niger across the intervening
highlands lying between the two rivers. French arms
were not slow to follow where French explorers led,
and speedy preparations were made to complete the
base of operations for the final advance to their promised
land.</p>

<p>Meanwhile our representatives on the coast, stewing
in their miserable, disease-stricken belt, were not blind
to the progress being made by our enterprising neighbours,
nor unaware of their vast designs of conquest
and commercial monopoly, and the probable result to
England’s political and commercial position in these
regions. In vain they drew the attention of the Home
Government to the situation, and asked for power to act
before it was too late. They were but as voices crying
in the wilderness, to which as little heed was paid as
gives the Bedouin to the desert mirage. More than
that, the coast authorities were told to let the French
go where they liked, and not to throw any obstacles in
their way.</p>

<p>The French were not slow to take advantage of the
field thus left open to them. By 1880 their line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
forts on the Senegal was completed, and everything
ready for their next move. For this enterprise Captain
Gallieni was appointed leader, and at the head of a
small army of drilled troops, and a considerable train
of donkeys, native drivers, native servants, &amp;c., he
started in 1880 on his mission of planting the French
flag on the Upper Niger, where, from our geographical
position and priority of exploration, the Union Jack
alone should have floated.</p>

<p>As far as the confluence of the Bakhoy and the
Bafing, the march of Gallieni was attended by nothing
worse than the usual amount of worry and trouble
incident to the passage of a small army through a
barbarous or semi-barbarous country. Beyond, however,
lay the unoccupied and but partially explored
country between the Senegal and the Niger. Here the
special trials and cares of the expedition commenced.
Food was often obtained with difficulty. Their advance
was naturally viewed with suspicion by the natives,
and much care and tact was required to prevent friction.
In spite of all obstructions, however, they
gradually pushed south towards their goal, leaving
French flags in the hands of the chiefs, and bearing
with them treaties placing the latter and their people
under the protection of France.</p>

<p>Before the Niger was reached the expedition came
near being destroyed by a determined attack made on
it by a people called Beleris. The Beleris were successfully
repulsed, however, and two days later Bammaku
on the Niger was reached, where already the tricolour
was found floating&mdash;an advance section of the party
having succeeded in concluding the customary treaty.
By what means the treaty was obtained we are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
told, though we do learn that Gallieni’s reception was
cold and inhospitable.</p>

<p>It now only remained to get to Sego, to see the
Suzerain of the Upper Niger chiefs and kings, and
conclude a treaty with him. For this purpose Gallieni
crossed the Niger and travelled along the south side of
the river. On his arrival in the neighbourhood of the
capital, he was stopped, and ordered to remain where
he was, till his business was settled. Many weary
weeks and months were passed in the attempt to get
Amadu, the Sultan of Sego, to sign a treaty, placing
his country under a French protectorate. In the end
the necessary signature was obtained, and from that
moment French rule&mdash;on paper&mdash;was supreme from
the sources of the Niger to Timbuktu.</p>

<p>France, however, was by no means inclined to be
satisfied with a merely mental recognition of her
authority. With splendid energy and perseverance she
pushed forward her forts into the valley of the Bakhoy&mdash;the
watershed of the two rivers; and finally built herself
an abiding habitation on the Niger itself. At the
same time a railway was commenced, having for its
object the connection of the highest navigable point of
the Senegal with Bammaku. At the same time a gunboat
was carried over in sections, and put together on
the river, as a further symbol of French authority, and a
potent instrument to spread its influence.</p>

<p>To further secure their prize from the possible results
of the awakening of the British Government, France
set about isolating the River Gambia by a cordon of
treaties, leaving the waterway British, but making all
else French. To make her position yet more strong,
all the countries towards the upper tributaries and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
sources of the Niger were placed under French protection,
and almost the entire coast line from the Gambia
south to Sierra Leone was taken possession of. And
through it all our Government peacefully slept on,
having left orders not to be awakened; or it woke up
only to blink approval, delighted to be rid of the whole
troublesome business.</p>

<p>Sixty years before M‘Queen had written&mdash;“France is
already established on the Senegal, and commands that
river, and if the supineness and carelessness of Great
Britain allow that powerful, enterprising, and ambitious
rival to step before us and fix herself securely on the
Niger, then it is evident that with such a settlement in
addition to her command of the Senegal, France will
command all Northern Africa. The consequences cannot
fail to be fatal to the best interests of this country, and
by means surer than even by war and conquest, tend
ultimately to bring ruin on our best tropical colonial
establishment.”</p>

<p>What M‘Queen had feared, had now come to pass,
as regards the political aspect of the action of the
French in the Niger kingdoms. It still remains to
be seen what is to be the commercial outcome of their
African dream.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>THE ROYAL NIGER COMPANY.</i></span></h2>

<p>It has ever been a good thing for British commercial
enterprise that its agents have never had to rely on
their Government to pioneer new trade routes, and
secure for them unexploited territory. Our merchants
have required nothing but a free hand to cut out their
own paths, and that the fruits of their labours should
not be taken from them by the political action of other
nationalities. What has been accomplished on these
terms let half our colonies say.</p>

<p>The above rule, though general, has not been invariably
applied, as witness the case of West Africa, already
described, in which, as the result of Government
restriction and interference, the harvest of British labour
has passed into French hands, and commercial enterprise
has become crushed and degraded along with the
regions in which it has been carried on.</p>

<p>Happily for our position in West Central Africa, the
Niger basin never fell under these blighting influences.
When our Government withdrew from that region it
withdrew completely, otherwise there would have been
yet another chapter of lamentable mal-administration
and gross betrayal of a nation’s trust to add to the annals
of West African history.</p>

<p>The Niger was thus left free to be made the most of
by the operations of private enterprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>For a few years after Baikie’s expedition nothing
more was done to establish a trade in the river. Not that
the task was abandoned as hopeless. On the contrary,
new plans were germinating and steadily taking shape
and form preparatory to renewed attempts under more
hopeful conditions.</p>

<p>By this time people had begun to realise more
thoroughly the nature of a tropical life, and knew
better how to fight the insidious and dangerous influences
of excessive heat and moisture, and the germs
of disease they fostered. By substituting quinine for
the lancet in the treatment of fever, that hitherto deadly
disease had been robbed of half its terrors.</p>

<p>Once more Macgregor Laird&mdash;a name that must be
bracketed with those of Park, M‘Queen, and Lander&mdash;was
the leader in the new movement. Undaunted by
past losses and failures&mdash;on the contrary, shown by
their teaching how victory was to be achieved&mdash;he
again entered the Niger in 1852&mdash;this time not to leave
it till he had laid the permanent foundations of British
commercial influence.</p>

<p>In this new enterprise the pioneer did not restrict
himself to mere voyages up the river and passing calls
at the chief marketing centres. He established stations
at various points, in the form of movable hulks moored
in the river, which had the double advantage of being
capable of removal bodily, and of providing a certain
measure of security from hostile attack. At the same
time, profiting by past experience of the deadly nature
of the climate, the number of European agents was
reduced to a minimum, and educated coast natives were
employed instead.</p>

<p>Palm oil, ivory, and Benni-seed were the sole pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>ducts
exported&mdash;cotton goods, metals of various kinds,
beads and salt, being the chief articles given in exchange.
Nearer the coast, gin, rum, gunpowder, and
guns were largely in demand, as a result of the old
shameful days of slave dealing. A profitable trade was
soon established, and before many years Macgregor Laird
had to compete with new firms who sought to share the
profits.</p>

<p>But though the Europeans thus increased in numbers,
their position continued to be extremely precarious. The
cannibal tribes of the delta were not slow to recognise
that their monopoly of the trade of the upper river
was being completely abolished, and they sought to bar
the way by incessant attacks on the steamers and stations
of the various traders. These having conflicting interests,
could not be made to combine for common action against
the common enemy. From time to time a gunboat paid
a hurried punitive visit, but produced no permanent
impression upon the refractory inhabitants.</p>

<p>The result of this divided action on the part of the
traders, and the growing power and truculence of the
native tribes, was extremely disastrous for Macgregor
Laird, who eventually was forced to retire from the
river.</p>

<p>Along with the growing dangers to the various houses
engaged in the Niger trade, new troubles began to loom
up before them, retarding the proper and healthy commercial
development of the region, and threatening all
in a common ruin. At first the field to be exploited
was so large that the traders came but little into conflict.
Gradually, however, with the entrance of new firms,
and the planting of new stations, they began to encroach
on each other’s districts. The result was soon seen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
the keen competition which ensued. The price of
native produce began to go up, till it threatened to rise
above its value. To keep the trade going profitably the
agents were forced to become more and more unscrupulous
as to the nature of the articles of import&mdash;more
and more regardless of the claims of their commercial
competitors. Each sought to drive the other
out, and the natives, not slow to see the advantages
to themselves, did their best to encourage the strife.
Under such conditions all legitimate progress was rendered
impossible. At any given point the inhabitants
were in a position to say, Thus far shalt thou go and no
further, or could clear the merchants out if they thought
fit. Enterprise requiring considerable outlay was out
of the question when the fruits were probably to be
reaped only by rivals. The trade, from being restricted
to useful articles, was rapidly degenerating, so as largely
to include vile spirits and weapons of destruction.
Gradually the conditions of competition were making
a wholesome trade an impossibility, and the natives,
instead of being bettered spiritually and materially by
European intercourse, were being driven down into
deeper depths of barbarism. A state of things which
our prophet M‘Queen had foretold in these memorable
words&mdash;“If this erroneous policy is pursued, then to
the latest period of time the central and southern parts
of that vast continent are doomed to remain in the same
deplorable state of ignorance, degradation, and misery
which has been their lot during the lapse of three
hundred years.”</p>

<p>This was a consummation of their labours which
the merchants could not contemplate with equanimity.
That they were honourable men we have no reason to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
doubt. True, they went to the Niger in order to make
money, but they had no thought of growing wealthy on
the ruin and degradation of the people among whom
they traded. They had become the victims of the circumstances
under which their business was carried on,
whereby they were driven irresistibly and even unwittingly
into the deplorable situation in which they
at length found themselves. In a manner they were
more to be pitied than blamed, for they had conjured up
a Frankenstein that threatened to be their ruin. To
one and all it was alike clear that as long as open unregulated
competition lasted, the character of the trade
could not be altered&mdash;must indeed go from bad to worse&mdash;their
profits become less and less, and their footing
in the country more precarious, subject as it was to the
whims, enmities, extortions, and restrictions of the barbarous
tribes, armed by the traders themselves with guns
which on occasion were turned against the vendors.</p>

<p>A turning point in the commercial history of the
Niger had been reached, and everything now depended
on the course pursued whether the next departure would
be for the weal or for the woe of all concerned.</p>

<p>Happily the right man was forthcoming at this
critical juncture, when the necessity of a change was
evident to all. Clear-headed, far-seeing business men
were in the trade&mdash;the peers among British merchants
wherever engaged; but something more was wanted in
him who should extricate his fellows from the difficult
situation in which they had placed themselves. Some
one was needed who, with business instincts and knowledge,
should combine the <i>savoir faire</i> and knowledge
of the world of the diplomatist. Such an one was Sir
George T. Goldie&mdash;then Mr. G. Goldie Taubman&mdash;a name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
which, like that of Macgregor Laird, must ever rank
in the galaxy of great names associated with the annals
of Niger enterprise.</p>

<p>At the time Sir George Goldie joined the Central
African Company of London, the only other houses in
the river were Messrs. Miller &amp; Co., Glasgow, the
West African Company of Manchester, and Mr James
Pinnock of Liverpool. Trade was carried on as far
north as Egga, though commercially the Benué still
remained a closed river. A visit to the seat of operations
was sufficient to make Sir George aware of the
exact situation, and the absolute necessity of a change,
if a legitimate and at the same time profitable trade
were to be continued. The other firms were already
impressed with the same opinion, and the result of a
little laying of heads together was the amalgamation
of all the firms into the United African Company in
the year 1879.</p>

<p>The happy results of this policy were soon made
apparent in improved profits. The expense of management
was enormously reduced. Where formerly there
had been floating hulks, permanent stations were built
on land, and at the same time the number was increased.
The Company thus found itself on an altogether new
footing with the natives, who could now be treated with
on equal terms. The trade grew by leaps and bounds,
and bade fair to become of national importance.</p>

<p>Naturally such prosperity could not continue without
attracting the envious attention of other nations, and
more especially of the French, who, having succeeded
far beyond their wildest expectations in reaping the
harvest sown by the English in the Upper Niger basin,
hoped by a little judicious manipulation to be able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
do the same along the lower course of the river, and so
carry out their dream of an almost exclusive African
Empire stretching from Benin to the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Under the patronage, more or less open, of Gambetta&mdash;certainly
instigated and encouraged by him&mdash;the
first feelers were thrown out in the establishment of
two commercial associations&mdash;the Compagnie Française
de l’Afrique Equatoriale of Paris, with a capital of
£160,000; and the Compagnie du Senegal et de la
Côte Occidentale d’Afrique of Marseilles, with a subscribed
capital of £600,000.</p>

<p>Happily for British enterprise in the Niger basin our
interests were watched over by argus eyes, else the
course of events would have taken a different turn,
French commerce bringing everywhere with it the
French flag and administrative system, to the eventual
strangling of any trade of ours.</p>

<p>The United African Company, till then private, was
promptly thrown open to the public, and the capital
raised to a million sterling. Thus provided with “the
sinews of war,” the Company proceeded to give battle
to the foreign interlopers, and speedily swept them out
of the entire region. None the less, however, did the
French contrive to do incalculable harm during their
brief inglorious career, under which the gin trade
flourished, and further anarchy was spread among the
savage tribes, as usual ever ready to take full advantage
of division and enmity among the European traders.</p>

<p>With the annihilation of the French Companies our
merchants once more reigned supreme, and all immediate
danger of French political and commercial
aggression was completely quashed.</p>

<p>The footing, however, which the former had even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
temporarily been able to effect, had shown the precarious
position of the British Company’s hold on the
country, unsupported as they were by Government
backing. They were still open to renewed attempts at
aggression&mdash;still liable to have the fruits of their labour
and enterprise wrested from them. Under such conditions
there could be no real attempts to develop the
resources of the country, or introduce new civilising
institutions among the natives, to effect which ends it
was perfectly clear that two things were necessary&mdash;first,
that the Niger basin below Timbuktu should be
declared British, as a guarantee against all further
foreign intrusion; and second, that a Royal Charter
should be obtained, under the authority of which the
Company would be enabled to proceed with the work of
development and progress.</p>

<p>The necessity of this latter step had already been foreseen
by M‘Queen long before the Lower Niger had been
explored, except in M‘Queen’s own mind. With an
insight truly prophetic, he pointed out that if ever Great
Britain’s mission in the Niger was to be achieved, it
could only be by means of a Chartered Company. While
deprecating a prolonged term of privilege, he argues that
its duration ought not to be narrowed too much, otherwise
that circumstance would tend to discourage the
merchant, and prevent him from laying out money at
the first outset, or embarking in the trade with that
vigour which alone could render it productive and successful.</p>

<p>In answer to the argument against exclusive privilege,
he shows that this exclusive privilege is for a trade
yet to be formed, and that the commercial conditions of
a civilised and an uncivilised country are totally diffe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>rent.
In the latter “everything is to do. Regular commerce
is to be created. Society is almost altogether to
be formed. Security and civilisation, law, order, and
religion are each and all yet to be introduced. Unity
of action and design, therefore, become absolutely
necessary to accomplish all these desirable objects&mdash;conflicting
interests amidst such a disjointed population
must and will indefinitely retard it. A charter is
clearly and indispensably necessary in order to conduct
mercantile affairs to a prosperous issue&mdash;in order to
regulate the supply, to explore the country and find out
the proper markets, to negotiate as an irresistible and
stable power with the native princes, to purchase lands,
to protect trade, to punish aggression, to rear up gradually
an empire in Africa such as had been done in India,
against which no native power shall be able to raise its
head. Then and not till then the trade may be thrown
open.... Without such regulations for a time there
is too good reason to dread that our connection with
Africa will never be more than the transient visitations
of insulated merchants,” &amp;c. &amp;c. In these and other
remarkable words M‘Queen graphically sketches the history
of the sixty years of British intercourse with the
Niger subsequent to the time at which he wrote. Only
after such a lapse of time, and through a long series of
mistakes and the rude buffeting of facts, were our eyes
opened to the necessity of taking his advice.</p>

<p>Even then, however, the National African Company
might have petitioned the Government in vain to make
the Niger secure from foreign aggression, or to put
them on the only possible footing to exploit and develop
a savage country lying under the blight of a deadly
climate, but for the sudden awaking of Europe to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
supposed-to-be vast latent possibilities of the African
continent. A magnificent bubble was puffed up into
view, dazzling all eyes with its iridescent hues, and
inflaming all minds with its promise of wealth and
power. European commerce was to be regenerated&mdash;the
pressure on the population was to be relieved&mdash;nations
were to rise in power and importance. El Dorado and
Second India were terms too weak to express the possibilities
of the future when Africa was under discussion.</p>

<p>Under the electric glow of the new craze deserts were
made to bloom like Eden, swamps became veritable
arcadias, the wilderness was repeopled, and peace and
a demand for European goods were discovered to be
the prevailing characteristics of the natives. The
result was the scramble for Africa, in which the
chief nations of Europe made themselves ridiculous by
the indecent haste with which they rushed to raise
their respective flags. Our own Government was the
last to feel the quickening influences, and then only
awoke under the pressure of public opinion, and after
much that should have been ours had been lost.</p>

<p>But for the National African Company the Niger
would probably now have fallen a prey to France or
Germany, but with admirable forethought they had
strengthened their position and secured their rights by
treaties with every native tribe from the mouth of the
Niger to the Benué. By virtue of persistent nagging
at the Foreign Office, these treaties were recognised
by Government, and a protectorate proclaimed over the
region thus acquired.</p>

<p>Then came the Berlin Conference in the winter of
1884, in which the free navigation of the Niger was
established, but the administration of the river from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
Timbuktu to the sea was left in the hands of the
British.</p>

<p>This was much; but more remained to be done. The
Niger and Benué above their confluence still lay open
to political and commercial aggression, which might be
fatal to the best interests of this country as well as to
the Company which had already done so much.</p>

<p>Thanks to the persistent efforts of one Herr Flegel,
the Germans were not slow to recognise this fact.
This indefatigable trader and explorer commenced his
career as a clerk in a trading house in Lagos. Filled
with an ambition to explore and extend German influence,
he contrived to ascend the Niger in British
mission steamers and trading vessels, spying out the
land wherever he went, and ever on the outlook how
the British bread he ate might be turned to German
account. With much daring and industry, and assisted
by German funds, he added much on subsequent trips to
our knowledge of some parts of the Niger and Benué.</p>

<p>The result of his inquiries and exploration was to fire
the German Colonial Society with the hope of establishing
their national influence in the regions beyond the
British Protectorate.</p>

<p>Happily the National African Company were as usual
wideawake, and soon became aware of the new danger
which threatened them. Immediately they set about
preparing to forestall any action on the part of the
Germans. Already in their self-imposed task of securing
Britain’s rights in the Niger they had used up all
the profits of their trade, but they had no thought of
shrinking from the work. To have the Germans in the
Niger would mean irreparable ruin to legitimate commerce,
and the flooding of the whole land with the styx-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>like
flood of gin which would inevitably flow in a devastating
flood from Hamburg. At this supreme moment
it became necessary once for all to secure the Niger basin
to Britain. The Company did the writer of these lines
the honour of inviting him to take up the task. Accordingly,
in February 1885, I found myself once more steaming
towards the tropics, while as yet my friends for the
most part imagined me recruiting in the Mediterranean
from the effects of my recent expedition to Masai-land.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>THE ROYAL NIGER COMPANY&mdash;(Continued).</i></span></h2>

<p>On the 16th March 1885 we entered the Nun mouth of
the River Niger.</p>

<p>Heavy leaden clouds hung overhead, from which rain
fell in a steady downpour, and lightning flashed at
rapid intervals. From time to time thunder crashed
deafeningly about us, or more distantly blended with
the monotonous impressive roar of the Atlantic breakers.
A steaming atmosphere threw its depressing shroud over
the scene, suggesting fever germs, and all manner of
liver and stomachic complaints. On all sides stretched
a discoloured reach of water, reflecting the leaden tints
overhead, and running into the mist-veiled mangrove
that ringed the horizon.</p>

<p>As we stood on the deck of the S.S. <i>Apobo</i>, under a
dripping awning, we could not but be infected by the
melancholy of the scene, and might doubtless have
exclaimed in Roman heroics, “We who come to die
salute thee,” but that we had to pack our traps and
prepare for landing.</p>

<p>A few more miles of steaming into this “white man’s
grave,” and our thoughts were diverted from the melancholy
of our immediate prospect by a new and more interesting
feature. There ahead of us, on the left, where
creek and mangrove met, a leviathian-like object stretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
its weird length far into the water, and laved its hundred
limbs in the placid depths. This was the iron pier of
Akassa, the then chief trading centre and depôt of the
National African Company.</p>

<p>Soon we were enabled to distinguish the beach strewn
with the relics of the ships and barges of other days,
and with the boats and canoes still in use. Higher up
lay piles of stores and palm-oil casks, while behind rose
a series of roomy warehouses built of corrugated iron.
Further seaward stood the quarters of the Company’s
agents&mdash;the whole cosily ensconced in the arms of the
mangrove forest, which in the distance looked fascinating,
but on closer acquaintance proved to be a fever-breeding
quagmire.</p>

<p>Such was Akassa, where throbbed with undying
energy the busy current of British commercial life.</p>

<p>With our arrival in the river my days of ease were
over, and prompt action and stern work became the
order of the day. No one knew where Flegel was, or
where he might turn up. With his minute knowledge
of the river, he was a rival not to be despised. It
behoved me, therefore, to waste no time, and accordingly,
having collected such stores as were necessary, I started
on my voyage in the steam launch <i>Français</i> two days
after reaching Akassa.</p>

<p>For the first hour we steamed up the rapidly narrowing
creek till we found ourselves confronted by a dense
barrier of mangrove. For an instant we seemed to be
insanely heading to wreck and disaster, when all at once
the wall of vegetation presented a narrow opening, and
we were engulfed in its leafy depths. Could this be the
Niger&mdash;the mighty river which drained the quarter of a
continent&mdash;only a stream thirty yards in breadth, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
some five in depth, lazily flowing seaward? That stream
was formed of Niger water, but it was not the Niger.</p>

<p>Up this insignificant winding waterway our course now
lay. First there was mangrove and nothing else simulating
the appearance of dry land, alternately exposed
as pestilential mud or covered by water, according to the
state of the tide. After a time land appeared on the
level of the highest tides&mdash;the swamp vegetation began
to exhibit a less vigorous growth, and was intermingled
with other trees and bushes. Each mile made the
transformation more marked. The land rose higher
and higher; the mangrove trees grew more stunted and
fewer in number; terrene plants took their place, and
grew in size, in beauty, and in majesty, till the ideal
tropical forest spread its romantic depths before our
admiring eyes.</p>

<p>Coincidently other developments of the panorama
were taking place. The river gathered together its
various branches and increased in breadth and depth,
till in its full majestic unity it sunned its broad bosom
in the tropic glare&mdash;a magnificent stream from a mile to
a mile and a half broad.</p>

<p>With the gathering together of the various branches
and the improvement in the physical conditions, evidences
of human occupation began to show themselves.</p>

<p>For the first eight hours not the faintest trace of man
had been discernible. Then appeared a deserted fishing
weir, next an old plantation, by-and-by a new clearing,
and immediately after a canoe propelled by two women,
which was seen creeping slowly along under the river’s
banks.</p>

<p>At last, towards sunset, a couple of villages were
sighted, and thenceforward man proclaimed his sway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
over the land, giving animation to the scene, with now
and then a picturesque effect.</p>

<p>As we continued our course our eyes were greeted by
the sight of much that Lander and his successors had
only dreamed of as the possible to be. Already trade
had laid a prosaic hand on the great highway of Tale and
Travel&mdash;the river sacred to romance, whose “golden
sands,” by the alchemy of its touch, are now transmuted
to a golden freight of palm oil.</p>

<p>The surging screws, the puff of steam and clang of
machinery, break the impressive stillness of the forest,
and fill the tropic air with their unhallowed echoes,
driving the hippo from his favourite pool, the crocodile
from the yellow sand-bank. Amid such sounds, the
shrill scream of the parrot, and the indignant chatter of
the monkey, strike upon the ear with a strange sense
of incongruity.</p>

<p>Here and there the graceless front of a trading station,
with its whitewashed corrugated iron walls and roof of
European design, glares forth unblushingly from its bosky
niche of palm and silk cotton tree. Thence issues the
matter of fact trader&mdash;no longer in the picturesque disarray
of the “palm oil ruffian,” but resplendent in the
dazzling glory of a well-starched shirt and snow white
duck trousers&mdash;who strolls down to the landing-place
through a garden aglow with sunflowers and walks shaded
by a canopy of trailing vines and other creepers.</p>

<div class="center">
<a href="images/i_355_large.png"><img id="i_355" src="images/i_355.png" width="600" height="287" alt="" title="Click for a larger version" /></a>
<p class="caption">TRADERS’ HOUSE, ABUTSHI.</p></div>

<p>The natives around the station share in the unromantic
changes. They still carry about with them an
air of picturesque sansculottic barbarity, but jarring
elements have been superadded. The negro has degenerated
into that hybrid creature the “nigger,” bids
you “good morning” as he asks for a pipe of tobacco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
or a nip of gin, or calls your attention to his lawn-tennis
hat&mdash;the latest fashion, and almost his sole dress.</p>

<p>The only circumstance which serves to maintain an
air of romance about him is the knowledge we possess
that he still loves his neighbour to the extent of becoming
at times literally one flesh with him.</p>

<p>Everywhere there is evidence that the trader is in
possession. The missionary has accompanied him, eager
in the cause of Christ and humanity. Not unfrequently
the sweet tones of the church bell may be heard ringing
silver clear from the cathedral gloom of the forest.
They call, alas! to those who will not hear, though
doubtless to the yearning ear of faith those sweetly
solemn sounds shape themselves into a prophecy of the
coming good destined to re-echo some day through every
forest depth and wide waste of jungle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, whatever be the future of Christianity in
these lands, one thing becomes abundantly clear to us
as we continue our ascent of the river, namely, that it
is not the only religious force which is penetrating the
sodden mass of Niger heathenism. Islam, with untiring
missionary enterprise, has entered the field and
thrown down the gauntlet to the older religion for the
possession of the natives. Unhappily so far, as compared
with the advancing tide of Mohammedanism, the
progress of the Christian faith is practically at a standstill.
Half way between the Delta and Lokoja the
pioneer Moslem outposts are found wielding a marked
and yearly increasing influence on the ideas and habits
of the natives. With each mile nearer the Sudan that
influence becomes more and more discernible, till before
we have reached the confines of Gandu we have altogether
left behind the congenial trinity&mdash;fetishism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
cannibalism, and the gin bottle&mdash;and find the erewhile
unwashed barbarian in a measure clothed and in his
right mind, instinct with religious activity and enthusiasm,
and wonderfully far advanced in the arts and
industries. Here it is clear that we are in the presence
of no assumed veneer, no mere formality, no extraneous
influences to bolster up a savage people to the semblance
of higher things, but face to face with a force which
has taken deep root in the lives of the inhabitants and
altogether transformed them.</p>

<p>On nearing Lokoja we bade adieu to the reeking
plains and dense forest region, and entered a picturesque
section of lofty table-topped and peaked mountains,
delighting the eye by their varied shape and rugged
aspect&mdash;here stern and threatening with bare precipices;
there basking under the tropic sun in smiling slopes,
beautified and shaded by groups of trees; at other places
swelling upwards and towering into fantastic peaks.
But however delightful to us as passengers and spectators,
this part of the journey was anything but
pleasant to our skipper, whose whole thoughts were
absorbed by the hidden rocks in the river-bed and the
fierce currents which swirled around them.</p>

<p>The passage, however, was safely accomplished on the
evening of the 25th, and we anchored off Lokoja just as
the last glints of sunshine passed from the hill-tops, and
gave place to the sepia shades of evening.</p>

<p>In continuing our journey it now behoved us to proceed
with more circumspection. We had reached the
southern confines of Gandu, the western half of the
great Fillani (Fulah) Empire. At this time Maliké,
Emir of Nupé, held a complete monopoly of the trade
between the Company and the rest of Gandu. We were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
only too well aware that any attempt to break through
this monopoly would be strenuously resisted by him,
and that therefore if he scented the object of our expedition
to his liege lord at Gandu, we might bid adieu to
all hopes of advancing inland. As our presence could
not be kept secret from him, we thought it well to send
him a letter merely to intimate that we were passing.</p>

<p>On the 28th we left Lokoja and pushed on to Rabba,
at work now in dead earnest, making up loads in the
small hold of the launch, where we were nearly roasted
alive. At various stations porters were shipped secretly
and stowed away in barges, everything being made ready
for a surprise-march the moment we landed.</p>

<p>On the 8th April we reached Rabba, from which our
land march was to commence. Maliké was still expecting
a visit from us at Bida, when we were actually landing
a hundred miles to the west with a hundred and twenty
men, two educated negro traders, one Arab interpreter,
and two Europeans besides myself. So completely had
all our plans been laid that we started on the following
day, leaving the chiefs and headmen dumfounded and
perplexed, not knowing what to do without instructions
from the capital.</p>

<p>Our first feelings of joy on leaving Rabba behind were
speedily damped when one of my European companions
got his leg broken, and had to be promptly returned
to the launch. Soon a shoal of troubles and worries
descended on us. The headmen of the various districts
began to throw every possible obstacle in our way,
refusing us guides, porters, and food. The men, unaccustomed
to scanty fare and the steady grind of a
caravan march, mutinied, and tried to force us to turn
back. They threatened to murder us, and more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
once presented their rifles at us by way of intimidation.
One man tried to stab me, and was only secured after
a terrific struggle, the porters passively looking on.
Yet it was a matter of life and death to us that we
should press forward in spite of all opposition&mdash;a few
days might mean ruin to the expedition, by giving the
emir’s messenger time to come up with us. The thought
inspired us to redouble our exertions. We fought like
men at bay, though we were but two against a hundred
and twenty; and happily by dint of machiavellian strategy
and diplomacy, with not a little determined flourishing
of revolvers, we came out of the battle triumphant&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>safe
beyond the clutches of Maliké, and complete masters
of the situation.</p>

<div class="center">
<img id="i_360" src="images/i_360.png" width="600" height="466" alt="" />
<p class="caption">HAUSSA HUT.</p></div>

<p>It is quite beyond the scope of this chapter to tell how
we continued our way through Nupé to Kontakora, and
thence by way of Yauri, the Niger, and Gulbi-n-Gindi to
Jega, Sokoto, and Wurnu, where the Sultan of Sokoto
had established his court.</p>

<p>Here we were in a region teeming with varied interest,
having reached the religious, political, and commercial
centre of the Western and Central Sudan. We could
hardly believe our senses, and realise that we were in
the heart of Africa, among a people popularly called
negroes. Rather did it seem to us as if, worn out by
the tiresome miles and the monotonous jogging of our
horses, we had fallen asleep, and in a dream imagined
ourselves in some part of Moorish Africa. A blazing
sun beat down with terrific effect upon a parched land,
in which here and there appeared green oases of acacia,
baobab and <i>doum</i> palm, in which nestled villages and
towns half hid by the grateful shadow of the foliage.</p>

<p>On all hands, as we pushed along, we were reminded of
Mohammedan customs, of eastern amplitude of dress, if
not of gorgeousness of colour. Everything bore the impress
of Moorish ideas and North African civilisation.
In the early dewy mornings, in the sultry heats of noontide,
at the close of the tropic day, we could hear the
sacred call to prayer. By the wayside, far from mosque
and town, were to be seen spots marked off by stones,
which with silent eloquence invited the dusty and footsore
traveller to stay his weary march and wean his
thoughts for a moment from his worldly affairs.</p>

<p>The types of men, the fashions in dress, were of the
most varied character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<p>Specially interesting were those mysterious people the
Fillani, or Fulah, numbers of whom passed us from time
to time. Simple herdsmen, semi-nomadic in habit, and
semi-serfs in position at the beginning of this century&mdash;warriors
and Mohammedan propagandists a few years
later&mdash;they are now the rulers of a hundred races between
the Atlantic and Bornu. Portentously picturesque,
with their voluminous garments, their massive
turbans, and <i>litham</i>-veiled faces, they pranced along on
gorgeously caparisoned horses with the dignified bearing
of the Moor.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="caption">PORTRAIT OF THE SULTAN OF SOKOTO’S BROTHER.</p></div>

<p>More numerous were the Haussa, the most intelligent
and industrious of black races.</p>

<p>Very different from this interesting people were the
Tuareg visitors from the plateau lands of Asben, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
stalked past us in artistically ragged dresses, with eyes
which seemed to glow in the shadow of their face cloth
and overhanging turban with the fiercest of human
passions.</p>

<p>On the 24th May the goal of our expedition was
reached, and the object of our mission attained a very
few days after. No time was then lost in proceeding
to Gandu, where similar success met our efforts; and
then with treaties written in Arabic, sealed with the
seals of the two Sultans, and signed by their respective
wazirs, practically placing their two empires under a
British Protectorate, and giving all commercial privileges
to the National African Company, we commenced,
with no small elation, our return home.</p>

<p>The one unpleasant occurrence which marked our
journey coastwards was the stealing of my journals and
personal effects, though happily the precious treaties
remained safe. Rabba was duly reached, and thence
we continued our way down the river in canoes to
Lokoja. On the way the German expedition, which
had meanwhile been set afoot with a view to forestalling
other nations in the regions we had just quitted,
was met moving up the river, all unconscious of the
fact that not a yard of ground from Timbuktu to
Akassa, or from Bornu to Yoruba, had been left on
which to plant the flag of the Fatherland.</p>

<p>Within seven months after leaving Liverpool I was
back home again, my work successfully accomplished in
a much shorter time than at the outset I had dared
to hope.</p>

<p>Next year our Government, now awake to the errors
of the past, and recognising the incontestable claims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
and magnificent patriotic enterprise of the National
African Company, granted it a Royal Charter, and the
right to the title of Royal Niger Company, which it
now bears.</p>

<p>The Right Honourable Lord Aberdare was its first
Governor, and Sir George Goldie&mdash;to whose diplomatic
genius and untiring industry this country as well as
the Company owes so much&mdash;was the Deputy-Chairman.
Around these gathered as counsellors and advisers many
who had been among the pioneers of British trade and
influence on the Niger, and had assisted in preparing
the way for the magnificent national undertaking they
have lived to see inaugurated. Among these are the
Messrs. Miller, Mr. Edgar, and Mr. Croft, whose names
cannot but find an honourable place in the annals of
the Company.</p>

<p>Of the career, bright with promise, upon which the
Company has thus entered, it is unnecessary to speak
at length. Already good results are flowing from the
new administration. The gin traffic has been taken in
hand, suppressed where possible, and restricted elsewhere
by enormous duties. Arms and gunpowder are also no
longer sold wholesale to the savage natives. The resources
of the country are being tested and developed
as they never were before, and with the most gratifying
results.</p>

<p>In closing this record of Niger exploration we cannot
do better than quote the prophetic words of M‘Queen&mdash;applicable
still, though later than they might have been
in approaching fulfilment. He it was who first conclusively
demonstrated the course and termination of
the great river. His was the first warning of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
certainty of the French advance; his the clear vision
which foresaw the necessity of a Chartered Company.
Let him, then, speak for the future, foretelling what is to
come, as he foretold what is now past, in the concluding
words of his Commercial Survey of the Region.</p>

<p>“I have thus, though feebly, I confess, in comparison
to the magnitude of the subject brought forward, completed
the object which I had in view, namely, to call
the attention of the British Government, and the power
and energies of our people, to an honour of the first
rank, and at the same time endeavoured to rouse the
resource and enterprise of our merchants to engage in
a trade of the first magnitude. By means of the Niger
and its tributary streams, it is quite evident that the
whole trade of Central Africa may be rendered exclusively
and permanently our own.... To support and
carry into execution the measures necessary to accomplish
this undertaking is worthy of the ministry of
Great Britain, and worthy of the first country of the
world. It will confer immortal honour on our native
land, lasting glory on the name and reign of George the
Fourth, bring immense and permanent advantages to
Britain, and bestow incalculable blessings and benefits
on Africa. Agriculture, manufactures, and commerce,
learning and religion, will spread rapidly and widely
over a country abounding in the richest productions
whether on the surface of the earth or below it, but at
present a country overspread with the most abject servitude,
and sunk in the deepest ignorance, superstition,
and barbarity. Every obstacle will vanish before judicious
and patient exertions. The glory of our Creator,
the good of mankind, the prosperity of our country, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
interest of the present and the welfare of future generations&mdash;glory,
honour, interest call us, and united point
out the sure path to gain the important end. Let but
the noble Union Ensign wave over and be planted by
the stream of the mighty Niger, and the deepest wounds
of Africa are healed.”</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
